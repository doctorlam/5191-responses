<h2> XSLT and its use for a technical communicator </h2>
<p> XSLT stands for Xtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations and it is used to transform XML data. The output from an XSLT conversion can be in XHTML, PDF, ZIP, Text or XML. </p>
<p> The importance of XSLT for a technical communicator is its use in converting single source data into a multitude of formats. In our previous readings, we have seen the importance of content management for technical communicators of the future (as well as the present, to be honest). This language helps read and present XML files in a format that parsers can read and understand and helping it display the necessary information. </p>
<p> XSLT can help technical communicators actually display XML content when they work in organizations, because different part of organizations might use the single-sourced data in different ways, and a single style format for all of them might not work. Coding in HTML would means thousands of line of code. This is where XML comes in. XSLT just helps display the XML data in the desired format. </p>
<p> For example, the website of the organization might need some of the central information in a brief paragraph. This would mean that a technical communicator writes some XSLT code that makes use of a few lines of information and displays it in an attractive style, using CSS and XSLT. Some information manuals produced by the same company might require the content of the XML pages, and a different XSLT page might be written for that specific data. This reduced the workload for a technical communicator. It also adds another dimension to the job profile of a technical communicator and helps him gain importance in the organization. </p>
<p> XML documents can stand by themselves, but they would not make much sense to a layperson. XSLT helps make this data intelligible. XSLT is as closely interlinked with XML as butter is with bread. </p>
