Coming to Content Management: Inventing Infrastructure for Organizational Knowledge Work 
This article changed my perception of content management and how technical communicators work as content managers.
I imagined content management as being a position within a company that keeps all of the content that is imported and exported consistent.
I was unaware that content management could have a research side and be a specialty position that could be hired out for different companies.
I am surprised and excited to know that content management can be so closely related to user experience and research.
I have found the articles assigned to me this semester in school about user experience and usability to be very interesting and helpful.
After reading this article, I think of content management as a position or means to find the best way to organize and use the content you have
and less about maintaining consistency in the content you create. Maybe I am just now grasping this concept, but it is empowering as a technical
writer who is written out as a victim of technology in so many articles to be described as a research-based position. Research seems much more
concrete than tools and/or technologies.

The Impact of Single Sourcing and Technology
The more I read about single sourcing the more that I notice it to be everywhere. For example: the discount clothing site that I am a member
of that only shows me brands that I have ‘liked’ and only shows me clothing in my size; my wine of the month club that pulls wine that corresponds
with the information gathered from my taste test; or the stations I have molded to be unique based on thumbs up or thumbs down on Pandora.
Once again, I feel like this article also empowers technical writers, we become “more like architects and less like construction works.” I feel that
the variety of job titles that we (TC/TW’s) can have scare some people but to me it’s a lot like being a business person. Marketers, financers,
executive officers, and operating officers all have their own titles but they all work in business. I compare this to the specific titles like editors,
writers, information designers, and content managers. We may all have different titles but we are still technical communicators/writers.
