The Hart-Davidson alters my perspective on a technical communicator's role within an organization in the sense that with each article assigned to read the theme is still “we aren’t just writers anymore.” And I feel that I have had some sort of a handle on this, but I can see how it is a little scary for already in the field TW’s. 

I think that this on going theme is made more solid in the email that Hart-Davidson shares because of her “ambiguous job title.” I think that working as a technical communicator, your job title doesn’t have much clout because we do and are expected to do so many other things. 

I though it was interesting that the article brings up supervisor and manager roles for technical communicators. I think it’s a catch 22 for the age old ‘writers.’ This article touches briefly on the fact that we constantly have to argue that we bring something to the table. I think that being in a supervisor/management position definitely does that, but it also comes with more responsibility. 

The idea of user generated content is brought up and I think portrayed in a fearful way. I personally don’t think that it is as bad as to say that it will put technical writers as a job. I don’t think it will put my generation of technical writers out of a job because we are already being advised and taught that we need other skills. I think that before we are put out of jobs we will just change job titles and shift our skill sets.
