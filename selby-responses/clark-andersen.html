   What do Clark and Anderson say about technologies like XML? How does technology (and XML in particular) fit into their notion of sustainable technical communication?

This article brings light to the theory that technical communicators need to change their approach and move away from the “technology is tool” approach.
Clark and Anderson give the idea that technologies like XML support knowledge management. He says that even though many technical communicators are able to re organize and manage information, many are not taken seriously. The authors state that this is because technical communicators put so much focus on the ‘new.’ 

By focusing on the ‘new’ I think many technical communicators are over looked for input on projects.  The authors say that we need to focus on using tools and technologies in a bigger picture sense and use them as apart of organizational strategies. Technical communicators can no longer be cubicle workers and we must bring a business sense to the table.  I think XML fits in to this because it fits into the ideas of designing and providing information with context.  At the same time, the information provided helps the end-user as well as the businesses that provide it as well. Because of this, XML and similar technologies are helpful to technical communicators because they help us move up the corporate ladder and give us more value than being a ‘tool jockey.’ 

Aside from the discussion, I really like the term affordances and how it can be applied to our wide range of skills.
