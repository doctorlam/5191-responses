For the XML project, I have succesfully created an XSL document that works and displays in the web browser.
I am in the process of adding some HTML and CSS. I'm going through some trial and error type situations but
I feel like I learn the most that way. I haven't made tons of progress since the last class, honestly. I hope to
make more progress tonight during the time that we would spend in class.

Some questions that I have are:
Do you want validation screen shots when we turn this in?
Do we need to make our table a sub-page to a home page?
