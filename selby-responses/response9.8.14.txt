I think what surprised me most was the theme “Jack of all trades, master of none.” 
Some of the lowest ranked technical competencies were specific skills that many schools teach when they should be focused on the root of the skill.  
I think this ties in mostly with writing. 

I think it’s very exciting that technical writers are being pushed to market themselves as interactive Web designers. 
It’s one more thing to add under the umbrella of technical writer. (pg 335)

I’m not surprised to see the self-motivation and ability to learn quickly characteristics listed. 
I think that UNT does a good job of making that very known but also provides the resources to learn a specific program. 
Again, I think the UNT program does very well at acclimating students to working in groups and with clients and preparing its students for that in the “real world”.  

I find it very interesting that the idea of ‘standardizing technical communication curricula to make transitioning into the real world’ (pg 335) is thrown out there. 
It seems like, to me anyways, that they only way to do that would be to stop making new programs and quit advancing in technology so that students can become masters at what is out there 
instead of having to stay ahead of the learning curve.  That’s not logical or possible. 
And this would mean that what I am mastering is completely different from someone who enters the program 2 years later than me. 

I think it’s surprising that using outdated technology because of budget constraints is important to managers. 
I think this ties into the idea of standardizing curricula. Software is expensive and if there is a technical writing standard of programs to learn, 
how will school funding come into play to continually buy the new standards?  

It’s reassuring that some managers are willing to provide training for skills I don’t have that they need if they think that I am a good fit for the position. (pg 333)
