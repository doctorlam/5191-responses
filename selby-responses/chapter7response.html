    <h1>What is XSLT and how is it useful for technical communicators?</h1>
    
    <p>XSL(T) is specifically Extensible Style-sheet Language (Transformation.) XSLT is a language that provides certain rules
    for transforming XML into a different format. XSLT is used to transform one XML document into many different formats. For example,
    one XML markup can be changed into HTML or a text based document. XSLT is also used to manipulate and change the XML output. For example,
    you can use XSLT to change the order or leave out information in certain documents</p>
    
    <p> XSLT is useful for technical communicators for two reasons. The first reason is knowing what something is and knowing how something
    works are two different things. I think it's important to know how XSLT works in order to know what single-sourcing is. By understanding
    how the XSLT is transforming the XML, I think we (tecnical communicators) can better understand our role in creating a document from the granual level. </p>
    
    <p>The second reason is the ever-popular trend of single-sourcing. It seems that there is no way to get away from single-sourcing so instead of
    beating it, we have to join it. I think single-sourcing and XSLT is useful for technical communicators because instead of making hundreds
    of user guides, for example, we can make one and use the XSLT to add or leave out information based on each audience and/or user. I think that
    XSLT is important for us because the future of us writing seems dim at most. I think that instead we will be organizing information and to do that
    XSLT will be a skill that we need to have a strong grasp on.</p>
