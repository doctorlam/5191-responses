I noticed many recurring themes across all our readings to date, mostly in regards to what skills technical communicators and technical communication curriculums might want to focus on in the coming years. Some to me are rather obvious: being able to work across functional areas, communicate effectively verbally and in writing, and being able to work with little direct supervision. Managers have better things to do than worry whether or not their “underlings” are doing their work. Companies produce effective products when all departments are involved with the process from cradle to grave. To do all of this, employees must be able to work together physically or via technology.

Spyridakis’s article agrees with the findings in all the other articles for the most part. However, she emphasizes usability and niche areas others labeled as less important. I understand her point: if technical communicators don’t know how to test their product, whether it is a website or database, then how will they know it’s effective before customers use it? Dicks talks about how the economy is user focused now thanks to the prevalence of the internet. Albers (2005) and Anderson (2014) both talk about usability’s importance in the technical communication realm, but Rainey, Turner, and Dayton (2005) and Lanier (2008) mention skills in usability testing as tertiary skills listed in job ads. I wonder if a look at current job ads would tell a different story.

I’m still trying to wrap my head around these authors stressing that TC curricula need to focus on the global nature of technical communication. Maybe it’s because my father worked with customers overseas (mostly in South America and Eastern Asia) for many years, or because I met many transplants from all over the world throughout my life, or even because I grew up during the expansion of the World Wide Web, but thinking globally seems so obvious it should be a given in both the classroom and in industry. If Rainey, Turner, and Dayton (2005); Spyridakis (2015); and Lanier (2008) are concerned that we technical communication students aren’t getting the skills they think are needed to create products for global customers, I’d like to know what they’d suggest. Should schools offer separate courses on how to write for readers in different countries (i.e. Technical Communication in China)? Alternatively, would an internship or work-study at a company with headquarters in multiple countries work just as well?

Spyridakis (2015) seems to be the only one who mentions programming as a good novel elective in TC curriculums. Most of the others mention markup languages and single sourcing as needed or useful skills, but programming mostly comes up as a low demand skill. I think programming is still relegated to software or computer engineers rather than being an integral part of technical communication. Most computer engineers I know don’t consider markup language, especially HTML, as “real” programming code.

The main theme across all assigned articles I noticed was that Technical Communication is changing rapidly with the development of new tools and technology, and therefore technical communicators need to adapt and keep learning if they want to advance in their careers.
