In his article Single Sourcing and the Technical Communication Career Path, Albers argues for a fundamental shift in the technical communication field. Albers says that the technical communication field currently works within a “craftsman model” and that technical communicators are “jacks of all trades, masters of none.” In the current craftsman model, each writer works on their own piece. Under this model, writers may include information that is redundant, contradictory, or inconsistent. 

Albers claims that single sourcing will force technical communication as a field to evolve beyond the craftsman model. He believes that technical communicators will become more specialized and that, in the future, technical communicators will work within their expertise. So technical communicators will stop being “jacks of all trades” and instead become specialized “masters.” Albers argues that this “specialist” model will be more effective than the current craftsman model. When technical communicators become masters, they are considered more valuable and integral to their organization. As Albers said, “Masters get asked to the meetings that decide strategic approaches and define company views of what type of knowledge should be disseminated and how should it be presented. Jacks, on the other hand, get told via e-mail the new way of doing things.” Albers wants technical communication to split “into distinct jobs based on experience.”

Albers did not significantly change my perspective on my future as a technical communicator. I agree with Albers argument that technical communicators need to stop being jacks of all trades and become masters, but I already vaguely understood that I would eventually become a specialist. But rather than becoming a senior technical writer, will I become an information analyst, information designer, or information architect instead? Albers did not explain what our new titles as specialized technical communicators would be or how technical communicators can become specialized.
