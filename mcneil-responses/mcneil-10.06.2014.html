	<p>Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is an XML language that controls the visual styling and formatting of XML data. XSLT can convert XML data to multiple formats including HTML. XSLT is to XML as CSS is to HTML. Designers use CSS to control the visual design of HTML documents and elements while writers use XSLT to control the visual styling of XML data. XSLT does not affect XML data, XSLT only affects how that data is styled or formatted. You can transform the same XML document using multiple stylesheets. So the same XML document can be transformed into an HTML page or a PDF. XSLT is what enables technical communicators to create multiple documents from a single XML file, commonly known as single sourcing.</p>

	<p>XSLT allows technical communicators to style and format their XML data so that the data is usable for readers. XSLT allows technical communicators to manipulate the original data and customize the output. Without XSLT, XML data is just marked up data in a format that is foreign and unusable to readers. XSLT lets technical communicators:
		<ul>
			<li>Add or remove data</li>
			<li>Rearrange data</li>
			<li>Combine multiple documents for a single output</li>
		</ul>
	For example, technical communicators can use XSLT to:
		<ul>
			<li>Insert boilerplate text</li>
			<li>Hide text</li>
			<li>Generate table of contents, index, links, and/or glossaries</li>
		</ul></p>
	
	<p>XSLT is extremely useful for technical communicators. It allows technical communicators to single source their documents, which saves technical writers time. Rather than rewriting the same content in a different format, technical communicators can instead use XSLT to output the same content in a different format. XSLT also minimizes consistency errors. Without XSLT, technical communicators would have to rewrite existing content for a certain output. When technical communicators rewrite content, they may not reproduce it exactly. But creating multiple documents from a single source through XSLT would prevent or minimize consistency errors. For example, Sally needs is writing a document on the same subject that Aaron already wrote about. However, Sally explains things differently than Aaron did or uses different terms than Aaron did. If Sally and Aaron used XSLT to single source their documents, their explanations and terms would be consistent. </p>
