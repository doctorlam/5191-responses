Clark and Andersen’s article is a call to action for technical communicators. Clark and Andersen think that technical communication academics and practitioners need to change their approach to technology and tools. Currently, technical communicators view technologies as tool to help end users and internal customers. Clark and Andersen stress that technical communicators must expand their view to include how technologies and tools affect their organizations. Clark and Andersen explain that our current view of technology as tools limits the context in which technical communicators work.

Clark and Andersen emphasize that technical communicators must consider how the technologies that we use, like XML, affect not just our end-users but also our organizations. Technical communicators must understand how the tools we adopt affect our organizations from a business perspective. So technical communicators must be trained enough to explain to organizational leaders and managers how the tools we use affect the organization’s bottom line. For instance, how does XML help the organization? How does it help the organization save money? Clark and Andersen explain that XML specifically forces technical communicators to closely examine information and determine what information is valuable to their organization.

For technical communication to be sustainable, technical communicators must expand their perspective of “tools as technology.” Technical communicators must be trained to expand the context in which we use tools. We must incorporate a business perspective to our current perspective. Our current relationship with technology limits our ability to change or impact the tools we work with. We must change to play a larger, more significant role in the organizations in which we operate. Currently, technical communicators are viewed as “tool jockeys” who are ultimately end-users of the technologies and tools we use and are not included in the conversation about developing those technologies and tools. Only after we expand our view will our profession receive more design credibility and organizational credibility.
