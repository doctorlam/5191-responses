After reading William Hart-Davidson’s Beyond Single-Sourcing, I feel more confident about my future role as a technical writer within an organization. Of course technical writers view their work as important and essential to an organization, but other articles have pointed out that technical writers must constantly justify their roles within an organization. We as technical writers know that we do much, much more than just writing, but it seems that other people, including coworkers and superiors, do not understand the full scope of a technical writer’s responsibilities or capabilities. But who can blame them? Not even technical writers are entirely sure what technical writers do. It seems like most people only hear the second half of our job title: “writer.” These same people then think that technical writers just write technical procedures and manuals all day every day. But this can be a very dangerous way of thinking because superiors examining ways to cuts cost could easily come to the conclusion that “everyone writes, so why do we need technical writers?” Technical writers must protect their job security by becoming more than just replaceable writers.

Content management finally names what technical writers have been doing all along. Technical writers rarely just write content, they also manage content. Throw the words “manager” or “manage” into your job title or description and you’re instantly more valuable to an organization. It’s easy to replace or outsource writers, but you can’t easily replace managers.

Hart-Davidson didn’t so much alter my perspective on a technical writer’s role within an organization as he did solidify it. I always knew that technical writers did much more beyond writing, but I did not have a proper name for it. Technical writers are also inherently content managers. Technical writers are not just content authors, we are also content managers. We play an important, specialized role within organizations that cannot be easily reassigned or replaced.
