What I found most surprising from Rainey, Turner, and Dayton’s article Core Competencies for Technical communicators was that managers admitted that they did not expect candidates to be expert users of the technology tools of the trade. I was surprised when the managers said they only expect candidates to be familiar with the tools and do not expect them to be experts. I was further surprised when managers said that they would train the candidates on how to use the technology tools. I found all of this surprising because it contradicts my experience when perusing job ads for technical communicators. Jobs ads for technical communicators appear very strict on what candidates should already know before applying to the job. Almost all job ads list knowledge and experience with certain tools of the trade as requisites for applying. To me as an applicant, it appears that I have no chance unless I am trained and familiar with the tools listed in the job ad. Therefore, I found the flexibility of the managers surprising. Similarly, I was surprised when managers considered a candidate’s curiosity and ability to learn a new tool quickly more important than already knowing technology tools. I was also surprised that knowledge and experience with technology tools of the trade were not considered a core competency by the managers. I did not expect managers to consider knowledge and experience with technology tools as the most important skill when searching for job candidates, but I expected it to be more important than what the article revealed. According to the article, writing skills and social skills rank above technology skills. I, of course, expected writing skills to be considered the most critical core competency, but I did not even consider social skills. So, I was very surprised when I read that managers consider social skills more important than technology skills.
