In The Impact of Single Sourcing and Technology, author Ann Rockley argues that single sourcing will redefine writing. Rockley argues that emphasizing technological skills has distracted our profession from communicating effectively. Before, technical communicators had to modify their tasks to match software. But “it is not we who must drive the configuration of the technology.” Rockley argues that we will become less dependent on tools and become more proficient communicators because single sourcing separates content from output. She also argues that writers will become information developers because they will be forced to examine how the information they write fits into the larger system.

In Coming to Content Management: Inventing Infrastructure for Organizational Knowledge Work, William Hart-Davidson et al. discuss how introducing content management within an organization potentially forces organizations to reconsider “why they exist and what they hope to accomplish.” Hart-Davidson et al. argue that content management is “a change in the technological and social infrastructure that makes their organization work.” William Hart-David et al. argue that introducing content management creates a need for an organization “to identify problems and develop inquiry strategies intended to guide the design of workable solution,” a need that can be fulfilled by technical writers. Thus, introducing content management makes technical writers more valuable.

Rockley and William Hart-David et al. both discuss the effects of content management, but on two different levels. Rockley focuses on how content management and single sourcing affects technical writers while William Hart-David et al. focus on how content management affects organizations as a whole. Both Rockley and William Hart-David et al. argue that content management causes individuals and organizations to reconsider and redefine their purpose. Writers must reconsider and redefine their function within an organization and organizations must reconsider and redefine their function and purpose. Thus content management affects technical writers on two levels: as an individual and as a part of an organization.
