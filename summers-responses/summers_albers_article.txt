Reflection on Albers’ Article “Single Sourcing and the Technical Communication Career Path”

Albers reminds us of the importance to specialize in something  and how the career path of a technical writer (TC) could be greatly impacted with single sourcing. He states that many TC students get distracted by “software X” when they would be better off learning XML and single sourcing. Albers mentions that in the future, which we are already experiencing because the article was written in 2003, TCs will need to contribute to projects in many ways, such as “developing and maintaining large dynamic information sets.” 

This article highlights some of the differences between “just writing” and being a big contributor within an organization. In my Digital Literacies course, we have discussed this shift. Many of the technical writing courses focus on the writing aspect, but TCs need to offer more than just strong writing skills. This course (D.L.) is the first one to help future TCs develop a skill that helps them fit into an organization. The XML, XSLT, and single sourcing knowledge that we gain in this course will set us apart from other candidates and it will help us be even more valuable.

Single sourcing benefits large organizations that need to produce a variety of deliverables. As writers, we need to understand how each word (element) “fits” in a document. While I did not experience single sourcing in my career, I am sure many organizations are using it and I need to be comfortable understanding/articulating this topic.
