My Response: Clark and Andersen on XML and Sustainable TC

Clark and Andersen point out technical communicators (TCs) have the ability to be valuable by integrating organizational knowledge and content management; however, few TCs received the type of training necessary for them to offer input on product design, or other organizational matters. Additionally, several TCs and TC instructors associate “tools” with technology, but Clark and Anderson suggest we expand those ideas to include the importance of skills/understandings needed in technology. Clark and Andersen also point out the tendency for TCs to focus on tools, which leaves larger business discussions to management. 

Clark and Andersen explain that TCs can use XML to better understand the data within their organization. According to Clark and Andersen, “XML compels them to reexamine just what information is of value to their organizations.”  TCs can use XML to study the way knowledge is articulated across the organization, closely examine it, and break it down to the granular level. XML lets them contribute more to the organization because they provide more than just data – they can provide data with content.

Clark and Anderson also added that TCs need to consider how the technology fits into organizational strategies. TCs need to know how to identify problems from a theoretical, organizational, cultural perspective. Looking at the bigger picture would help TCs understand larger design and policy issues instead of limited audience purpose problems. Also, when TCs understand the bigger picture they will know what to look for at the granular level (through XML) which could help them identify problems. TCs can take this information and contribute valuable input on business decisions. 
 
Technical Communication becomes a more sustainable profession when TCs understand more than just limited information about specific tools. For example, understanding how XML works and the significance of this level of data helps TCs explain the available content and offer suggestions on decisions.  As Clark and Andersen point out, TC programs focus on writing and how students can use tools to complete their rhetorical tasks. TC students would acquire a better understanding of technology and business needs if they received broader contextual training. With this type of training, TCs could articulate the significance of their work.
