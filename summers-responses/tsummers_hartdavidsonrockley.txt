Response on Hart-Davidson and Rockley

The Rockley article convinced me how single-sourcing fits into corporations. Prior to reading the article I struggled with how I could apply it to documentation/training team where I worked previously. After reading that specific article (and watching the assigned Youtube video) I began looking at the bigger picture. Rockley explains that someone could write the core information and then others could identify how the content applies to different needs. I now see the benefit. Instead of multiple writers (from different parts of the organization) chasing after info from SMEs, writers could use the same blocks of info and mesh into their audience needs. Writers are usually involved wherever the concept originates and then other departments re-write the same material, but this is duplicate work. Rockley describes it as wasted time.
 
The Hart-Davidson article stresses the importance of discovering content usage. I found it helpful to read about their case study where the NPO (national professional organization) had a website that differed from the way they operated. Scenarios helped the NPO see that there was a problem – especially with the type of relationship they were trying to construct. They (NPO) wouldn’t have realized this w/out the scenario type questions. The NPO finally understood that the website needed to have “the most important goals and tasks of the users, rather than the structure of the organization.” 

Another interesting point in the last article is the different “definitions” of CM (content management): software package you buy, a set of practices you train people to use,  or a new way of conducting business. Technical writers will need to be aware of these opinions and be able to articulate the benefits of CM.
