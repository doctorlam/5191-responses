My Response on Hart-Davidson: 
Hart-Davidson explains how employers are spreading the responsibility of content creation throughout their organizations. He reminds us that tools can reproduce existing content to be delivered in a variety of mediums. He continues to show the expertise needed by writers so that they become valuable communicators within these organizations - expanding their role from “writer” to a technical communicator (TC) and content manager.

Content management (CM) involves understanding/controlling the authoring roles – especially when multiple authors contribute to documents. Content managers/TCs must be experts on this part of the role and they must be able to communicate the rules to other authors. The goals outlined by Hart-Davidson show the necessary skills: leadership (distribute tasks, decide on translation/location/organization, and so on) and communication (clearly communicate the tasks/rules, and so on). The management and leadership responsibilities reflect the importance of the role, which adds value to the TC role within organizations.

Hart-Davidson’s article (in Chapter 5 of Spitka) altered my perspective on the TC role – especially the decision skills needed by TCs to expertly manage content. TCs need to understand how to organize content by audience need, document type, etc.; They need to understand how various mediums will produce the deliverables and decide which ones to use; TCs must become experts on the business organization so they can decide how to store content for end users; Also, TCs need to decide authorizing privileges and clearly communicate the rules. 

As a TC student, I am encouraged to develop many skills; however, I wonder if students are developing enough skills to prepare for business decisions. For example, group work experiences often involve writing projects, but they rarely reflect the real-life experiences TCs will see in corporations – especially since each department will have their own ideas/deadlines/motivation. I think project management experiences will help TC students understand the complexity of working with departments all over an organization - similar to the content management Hart-Davidson describes.
