		<h3>What is XSLT and how is it useful for TCs?</h3>
		<p>The acronym XSLT is used for Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations. Basically, XSLT is the language that transforms XML into other formats, such as HTML. For example: XML > XSLT > HTML > FO processor > PDF) Writers can use an XSLT processor to format one XML document into content for the web, print, or mobile. Peter WebExplorations’ YouTube video uses the example of two companies with different formats producing one deliverable. Even though the deliverables differ, the XML document (input data) isn’t changed. Writers would just use different stylesheets for each one.</p>
		<p>Cowan mentions that writers can also use XSLT to manipulate content:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create glossaries, cross-reference links, indexes, and table of contents.</li>
			<li>Combine multiple input documents to produce one output document.</li>
			<li>Selecting specific content based on metadata.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The XSLT processors can be stand-alone processors or they can be found in some publishing tools and web browsers. XSLT uses XPath to review each element. Deliverables are produced based on the rules in the stylesheet template and the nodes in the XML document.</p>
		<p>The reason why XSLT is important is the relationship to XML. XML separates data from presentation and it transforms data between applications (Kay, 2001). Kay continues to say that TCs can use XSLT to define how to extract/combine data from one XML document and generate another XML document. XSLT uses the “value-of” tag to extract the node selected by the XPath (mentioned previously). Prior to XSLT, custom applications were used to process XML documents (Kay, 2001). But XSLT is better than a custom application because TCs can set the declarative language and the rules for the template.</p>
