Reading Response to Rainey and Dayton Article

Rainey and Dayton explain their research on the competencies needed for technical communicator (TC) positions. They took a list of competencies that hiring managers wanted and had the managers rank the items. Through this research, Rainey and Dayton identified the top skills that TCs need to be ideal job candidates. Then they recommend adjustments for TC programs so that new TC graduates have those ideal skills/competencies.  

The research made sense but some of the rankings and recommendations surprised me. As a TC student, I often study the writing aspect because the writing skillset seems to be a huge part of the TC program. Based on the program and my previous experience I would think that writing skills would rank at the top. I was surprised that the ability to collaborate ranked above writing skills. Although these rankings make sense because hiring managers want to fill positions without disrupting the existing employees – those employees in which they have already invested. Potential candidates need to somehow prove they have the ability to work well with others.

Rainey and Dayton make an excellent point about TC curriculum. They interviewed TC experts who suggested that TC programs should incorporate knowledge about business psychology, business operations, and project management. While these suggestions surprised me, they make sense and relate to the collaborations mentioned previously. TC employees constantly work closely with a variety of professionals on multiple projects. As TC students, we experience group work but almost none of our courses incorporate the level of workflow seen in project management.  

The research and suggestions were enlightening. I wonder if TC programs will begin adjusting their curriculum by using more project management assignments and fewer group assignments. If so, will students need multiple projects going at the same time to fill gaps in workflow?
