Albers evaluates technical communication (TC) and the craftsman model, or the concept that technical communicators (TCers) are involved in the “crafting” of products from conception to finalized production. This model views TC with through broad lens, and more importantly, expects TCers to be masters of all the roles involved in production, including writing, editing, design, UT, and so on. Albers considers the “inherent problems” of this model, noting inconsistency on document, sentence, and word levels, as well as the inability to create dynamic content that can keep up with changing technology.

However, technology, industrialization, globalization, and digitization have collectively begun to replace the craftsman model with single-sourcing and other granule-centric writing methods. This shift has, according to Albers, put pressure on TCers to acquire specialization (both in terms of field and skillset) in order to remain valuable assets to their companies. However, Albers contests that 8 TC specialists will “contribute more than 8 craftsmen together working in the same room” (337).

Additionally, the increase of TC degree programs combined with the rise of single-sourcing (and other knowledge work) may also incite the rise of TC as a respected profession; Albers argues that cleanly differentiating between junior-level and senior-level personnel (in the same vein as is done at law firms, hospitals, accounting firms, and other professions) is necessary for professionalization. One point of is argument is that “senior people do not get lost in the details of writing” (339).

This article, in tandem with this class, has made me realize (even more than I already did) that I <i>need</i> to specialize in something (like Dr. Lam said in class, something “no one else can do”). This information is relevant to my future even though I will most likely not perform single-sourcing or even use the markup languages we’ve learned in class; these concepts are still relevant because the likelihood that someone will hire me to “craft” an entire product (or usability study) are increasingly slim.

Additionally, Albers’ points on professionalization and the distinction between levels of seniority also apply to my future; for while when first hired on somewhere I’ll be a junior-level, with experience my master’s degree will (hopefully) put me ahead of my bachelor-degree-holding peers. Because my graduate school (and teaching) experiences have made me face more uncomfortable, challenging, humbling, but ultimately maturing experiences, I’ll (in theory) be more capable of performing symbolic-analytic, critical-thinking work described by the senior positions that Albers conjures.

In terms of my response about Albers’ article changing my perception of single-sourcing—it more so reinforced an idea I’d already begun to develop, which is that modularization will increase, not decrease, the scope of technical communication on a field level. However, it still seems to me that the performing actual act of single-sourcing seems like working on an imaginary assembly line, changing piece by piece, as described by Weiss on 339.
