“How does Hart-Davidson alter your perspective on a technical communicator's role within an organization?”

Hart-Davidson reinvestigates the role of technical communicators (TCs) within the context of the “information economy,” where information itself has become a (in some places, the) commodity. He argues that the shift from product to knowledge in many organizations has meant that writers do not merely write, but also support and/or manage an entire “network of people who develop content” for all kinds of communication (e.g., internal or external, process or product, etc.) (128). 

This article has made me contemplate the actual effects (rather than just the reality) of TCs performing multiple roles within an organization. Much TC literature reveals that TCs do more than just write, contesting that they also edit, design, interact with SMEs while advocating for the end user, collaborate, use varying media and applications, create metadata using markup languages, and perform usability testing, et al. But Hart-Davidson redefines this multi-faceted to actually create an entirely different role of content manager (CM) for TCs.  One way the title of CM differs from TC is that TCs must appropriately, and accurately write content, while CMs are charged with sustaining the quality and efficiency of documents across departments and timelines. 

Oddly enough, some TCs view content mgmt. as a threat that will marginalize their statuses within organizations; for if everyone in the information economy writes, what’s left for TCs to do? One answer is broad content mgmt. that manages large groups of people who write together versus small writing teams. Another specialty they can bring to the table is effective use and understanding of SGML/XML, because even when more people are writing in an organization, not all will be (good at) using markup languages to enhance single-sourcing endeavors (132-4).

Yet another possibility for TCs is to perform in one three CM categories: 1) making texts, 2) creating/managing information assets and specifying display conditions, or 3) designing and managing workflow/production methods (135). And even though TCs will have a specific role in one of these categories, they will have to help coworkers perform their roles, as well. This leads to another area in which TCs can prosper, because although more people may be “writing,” only TCs have received formal training/are experts in writing well and for the appropriate social/contextual environment, so they will need to make sure that everyone else is maintaining a standard of excellence in this area.

In short, TCs should not fear the arrival of CM within their organizations, but rather embrace the growth leadership roles CM creates for them.
