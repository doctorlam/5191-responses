What do Clark and Anderson say about technologies like XML? How does technology (and XML in particular) fit into their notion of sustainable technical communication?

Like many other technical communication (TC) researchers, Clark and Anderson (C&A) examine the reasons for, and solutions to, the undervaluing of many technical communicators (TCers) within their organizations. However, Clark and Anderson approach the issue by evaluating and offering improvements to the training methods in academia and industry.

C&A believe that the sustainability and professionalization of TC can be achieved by training methods that focus on value-adding entrepreneurial, systems-design, and business skills at the organization level instead of tool skills at the document or project level. TCers must learn how to add value in ways that managers can relate to and appreciate; in other words, they must be able to define and work toward the bottom line within organizations in addition to the humanistic problems they’ve always undertaken.

The authors mention XML in particular as a technology that TCers can use to ascend the ranks of their organizations because XML allows authors to provide knowledge, or “data with context,” and disseminate it across “different branches of an organization” (290). C&A assert that XML and similar technologies will allow TCers to transition from “tool jockeys” that master whatever programs they require for their singular, narrow roles within organizations to more meaningful and valued positions such as usability specialists, information architects, or knowledge or content managers (KM or CM, respectively). They argue that these roles are more sustainable within an organization than a generalized TCer because they have clear, tangible effects on the bottom line of an organization.

Additionally, C&A believe TCers’ current segregated positions are what keep them away from the discussions that tackle larger rhetorical, design, and contextual questions with the developers and SMEs, much in the way that a group of engineers would not likely ask a mechanic to sit in on brainstorming or problem solving sessions. Implicitly, they call for the movement of user-centered (versus system-centered) design of the tools used by TCers by gathering direct input from TCers in the early stages of the design process and throughout development. If TCers can “tear down silos” within organizations and become “better integrated with existing processes,” (292) their value may be more evident to managers, stakeholders, and other influential people within organizations. ?
