ARTICLE: CARLINER, COMPUTERS AND TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION
QUESTIONS: 

1. In the early days, what was the difference between a writer and a production assistant?
Writers were considered “professionals,” whereas production assistants were considered “paraprofessionals,” or legally eligible for overtime. The technical writers were charged with actually creating content to be used as reference material. 

2. What changed in the mid-1980's that changed the nature of technical communication?
PCs became available to the masses, which increased both the “number and type” (23) of users to whom technical communicators wrote; technical communicators were no-longer writing for “technically astute users,” but rather for laypersons. Additionally, the 1980s marked the beginning of change from print documentation to online help-documentation (22-6).

3. When did technical writers become information developers? What happened in the organization to spur on this change in job title?
The mid- to late-1980s saw the change from “specialty-based job classes” such as technical writers, editors, and illustrators to a consolidated role: the information developer. This change happened as a results of the increase in demand for word processing and desktop publishing software, which in turn led to the demand for accessible resources for computer novices (24).

4. How has production changed from the 70's until now? What implications does this have for you?
In the 1970s, technical communication as a field was split into highly-specialized roles that moved a document along a metaphorical assembly line. Now, as technologies allow novice users to perform more tasks, the lines between these roles tend to blur. 

5. How has technical communicator's job responsibilities changed from the 70's until now? What implications does this have for you?
Technical communication started out as a very system-centered profession, meaning that writers’ main responsibilities revolved around documenting the static functions and features of products. Additionally, technical communicators primarily wrote to highly-trained professionals. However, the modern technical communicator strives to create user-centered writing and design that presents a situated user in an actual context. The demographics to whom technical communicators write has also changed to involve more people who access documentations more frequently. These people frequently have low- to mid-level experience using high-technology, so technical communicators must now make documentation more widely accessible. This means that one of the most significant roles of modern technical communicators is audience analysis, a quality that was usually missing from technical communication in the 1970s. Finally, the move from print to online means that technical communicators must consider information architecture and how design conventions change between the two media.

6. Why does Carliner talk about the classification (professional vs. para-professional) in regards to technical writers? 
The development of new technology ultimately created two tiers of technical communicators: the first are “software engineers” who are considered professionals and ultimately focus on human interactions with products and interfaces. Software engineers designed screens, forms, and applications for general consumers. The second group is made of “technical writers,” para-professionals who follow guidelines and best practices set forth by the first group. Carliner talks about these classifications to demonstrate the consequences of not adapting to new technologies; technical communicators who rely only on their ability to write well will fall behind into para-professionalism, and those who stay on top of evolving trends, technologies, and practices will surge ahead into professionalism.
7. In the 21st century, what are the key changes to the production cycle that impacts technical communicators?
The move from print to online has greatly impacted technical communicators by increasing the sheer number of target users. The convenience and expansion of the web means that people who would have never seen these technical documents can now access them with great ease. This shift also decreases the time, resources, and people required to create and update new documents. New technologies have also created more roles, such as information architects, web designers, and content strategists. Additionally, many companies seek the contributions of real end users through online interactions (29).

8. Currently, what are the "two tracks" of technical communicators that Carliner discusses?
Technical communicators tend to fall in one of two categories, the first being comprised of those who specialize in practices such as usability, human factors, user experience, information architecture, and related design challenges by programming and designing information databases. The second group provides the content for the databases and other media (29).

9. What specific technological changes impacted the way technical communicators work? What do you think is the most important technological change for your career?
The invention and development of PCs, online communication, and content management systems have impacted the media by which technical communicators work. Additionally, information databases have changed the way technical communicators work by establishing consistency and, in many cases, discipline-specific languages such as DITA. Also, databases allow external input from varying departments within an organization. Personally, as a hopeful future usability professional, the most important technological change for my career certainly lies with the vast permeation of the internet and the rapid evolution of web design, compatibility, accessibility (both financially and geographically) information architecture.

10. The changes from phase 4 to phase 5, as described by Carliner, are particularly relevant to you. What do these changes mean to you? How will you adapt to these changes? 
One of the most significant changes from Phase 4 to 5 includes the evolution of the internet into a two-way information highway, in which people can assume the roles of both users and SMEs simultaneously. Novice writers often use media such as blogs, wikis, and social media to provide content. The increase of who can write about what means that technical communicators must now interact with people who assume these authoritative roles with misinformation or hostility. Though perhaps one of the biggest impacts on new technical communicators is industry- and discipline-specific-standardization through the wide adoption of applications for certain tasks, such Microsoft Word for word processing, etc. (42). Content management systems have also increased the rate at which documentation is becoming standardized. 

11. When was XML introduced? What advantages did XML bring for technical communicators?
XML was introduced in Phase 4 of the 5 technological phases discussed by Carliner and became a W3C recommendation in 1998. One of the main advantages of XML is that it allows users to create their own tags (hence, it’s extensible) when standard tags are not appropriate or specific enough. XML also allows organizations to create boiler-plate documents with more ease.

12. What two words does Carliner use to describe phase 5?
Carliner calls Phase 5, the era of technological development from the mid-200s to the present, as Web 2.0., and defines it by its standardization and simplicity (42). These qualities have arisen partially as a result of the wide-spread adoption of XML.

13. One of the most alarming statements in Carliner's article reads "However, those who develop and produce content have been facing dwindling opportunities". What does this mean for you?
This means that in order to stay marketable, relevant, and valuable as a professional, I must stay on top of developing technologies in order to remain within the more employable “first group” of technical communicators. As Haywood writes in an article, “The Essence of Technical Communication,” it is not enough anymore to simply be able to write well. This qualification has become expected by managers across the communication and technology industries and is no longer the sole factor when hiring candidates. Additionally, more and more companies are outsourcing the jobs of “just writers” to parts of the world where labor costs are significantly cheaper, such as India and China. Another incentive to outsource jobs is the increase of the use of templates to create content.

14. What are the differences between authoring, publishing, and management technologies? What do these differences mean for you?
Although there is a degree of overlap among these three branches, they differ in the following ways:
•	Authoring technologies such as Word, Photoshop, and PowerPoint generally have WYSIWYG features that are useful in creating original content and editing content.
•	Publishing technologies such as Flash, Dreamweaver, and Madcap Flare, are used more for programming content to be published (mainly online) and requires code such as XML, HTML, and PHP.
•	Management technologies strive to facilitate convenience and efficiency with regards to data storage, version control, content management/standardization, and data translation across platforms. 

15. What does Carliner say about academic programs in technical communication? What implications does this have for you?
Carliner says that each program needs to establish its own balance of soft, durable skills and technological training (47). Although managers expect some level of training in industry-standard software, most graduate programs seek to provide students with skills that will apply to their careers decades after they graduate, such as critical thinking, problem solving, time management, and collaboration skills.  Because empirical data on this question is sorely lacking, understanding the implications of varying levels of theory and applicability taught in graduate schools will help program coordinators make the choices that will best serve their students.
