Information Literacy Exercise

Answer each question and write down information about the search terms, sources, types of sources, and credibility of sources.  
Note: All search terms are listed in the order in which they were used. 

1.	What is the difference between Java and JavaScript? Java and JavaScript (JS) are both object oriented programming (OOP) languages, which operate on all of the different parts of the code working together. However, Java is a programming language, while JS is a (text-based) scripting language. Additionally, Java usually runs independently of a browser as an application/applet once all the code has been compiled into a machine language (binary?). JavaScript works within an HTML document that is rendered by a browser. Because Java must be compiled before it works, to make changes, coders have to edit the source document and re-compile the code; however, JS can be edited from the HTML document itself. 
•	Search Terms Used? Java vs. JavaScript
•	Source: HTML Goodies
•	Type of Source: Q&A/forums/online community for web developers/programmers.
•	Credibility? 4. The site’s comparison of Java & JS seemed pretty reliable and thorough, so I reviewed the site’s About page to find that it’s been around for 18 years and contains 700 tutorials with over a million visitors a month. Its longevity in the web developing field along with its ample amount of monthly users makes me think I can trust its information. 

•	Search Terms Used? Java vs. JavaScript
•	Source: Java website
•	Type of Source: Private business website 
•	Credibility? 3.5. The Java website provides a plain-language, albeit somewhat bare comparison of Java and JS. However, many people on Stack Overflow seem to prefer JS to Java, so because of Java’s stake in its success/bias, they likely omit preferential language that indicates one’s superiority over the other. Additionally, I doubt that Java would list its own shortcomings on its website. 

•	Search Terms Used? Java vs. JavaScript
•	Source: Stack Overflow
•	Type of Source online tutorials/forum/Q&A site/online community for programmers.
•	Credibility? 4.5. I’ve used the site before, and I got a lot of help for my P2 database from the site.  Additionally, it’s a really well-known site, which adds credibility for people like me who are not that familiar with programming/tech culture. However, like with any online help, users are responsible for making sure that the exact problem/tutorial they’re looking at is what will help them/ is appropriate for their specific project, not to mention being aware of possible version incompatibilities/dated info.

2.	What is PHP? What is it used for? PHP, or “PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor,” is a scripting language that understands text, HTML, CSS, JS, as well as PHP. It is open source and rendered through a web server.  It’s a programming language, so it’s capable of “doing things” (rather than markup languages), such as collect data from forms and cookies, generate and block user permissions to access sites/parts of sites, encrypt data, and read and manipulate files. It’s especially useful because a PHP file can have multiple outputs, such as HTML, XML, images, PDFs, and video.
•	Search Terms Used?  PHP
•	Source: W3Schools
•	Type of Source: online tutorials, community, and standardization source for programmers/web develops
•	Credibility? 5. W3C is the most widely used source for web standards across the world; it’s been around for 20 years. Additionally, I’m fairly familiar with the site, and have accessed it numerous times for (successful) help on many projects in school, so I trust that its information is accurate and that it provides useful answers. 

3.	How do you create dynamic layouts using CSS? Create a virtual grid using div tags to separate content. Then apply absolute CSS position styles to the div tags, which makes all the div containers relative to one fixed-position container. 
•	Search Terms Used? dynamic layout definition
•	Source: Wikipedia 
•	Type of Source: free, public, online encyclopedia
•	Credibility? 4. Although Wikipedia is edited/maintained by the general public, it’s a good resource to get a foundational/seminal understanding of a topic. However, those who don’t already have a strong understanding of the topic they research on Wikipedia should expect to perform additional research to fact check or to learn that some information is construed or inaccurate.

•	Search Terms Used? dynamic layout CSS tutorial
•	Source: Smashing Magazine
•	Type of Source: Website/blog/online tutorials/forum dedicated to web development, technology, web design, UX.
•	Credibility? 4. I’ve never visited the site, but feel confident that it gives mostly accurate, pertinent, up-to-date advice. After doing a little research, I discovered the site is almost 8 years old and has received numerous accolades/awards within the web development community. Additionally, it as a professional, appealing “showy” design, which is essential for a web design website. However, like I mentioned before about online tutorials, even with credible resources, users have some accountability in making sure the article or forum they access is right for their project.

•	Search Terms Used? dynamic layout CSS tutorial
•	Source: Stack Overflow
•	Type of Source: online tutorials/forum/Q&A site/online community for programmers.
•	Credibility? 4.5 See answer to Question 1.

4.	What is the difference between single sourcing and modular authoring? They’re 2 parts to an often same process. Single sourcing is when content is stored somewhere (usually a database or content management system) and is selectively pulled from the single source according to audience, medium, purpose, and contextual needs. The single source often provides all the data necessary to transform information to multiple outputs. Modular authoring is the process of creating those content pieces that are stored in and pulled from the single source. To effectively write modular content, pieces should be as small as possible while still remaining whole enough to stand alone.
•	Search Terms Used? n/a
•	Source: TECM 5191 lectures, readings, and class discussions 
•	Type of Source: experience, journal publications, Q&As, conversations  
•	Credibility? 4.5. These are some of the most prominent points of discussions from class, so by now I just know what they mean. There is always the possibility that I misheard/misread something or that I’m misremembering, but I feel pretty confident in my definitions.

•	Search Terms Used? n/a
•	Source: The first MadCap Flare video, via the course website 
•	Type of Source video tutorial
•	Credibility? 4. The video comes straight from the publisher, MadCap, who has created an industry-standard, international topic-based-authoring tool.
