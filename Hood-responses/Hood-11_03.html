<b>Hart-Davidson, et. al.: Coming to content management-Inventing Infrastructure for Organizational Knowledge Work</b>
Hart-Davidson (HD), et. al. reflect on contrasting and evolving definitions and uses for content management (CM). CM has typically been regarded as a powerful tool that has a specific purpose for storing and organizing content, often towards the end of single sourcing. However, the authors view CM as an industry practice (a “type of conduct”) with which organizations can redefine their philosophies on documentation, from pre-conceptual methods of creating knowledge to arranging, storing, and retrieving said knowledge. HD et. al. predict that this view of CM will allow for technical communicators (TCers) to become influential in the actualization  of company missions vs. creating individual, specific documents and other tasks of passing importance. Additionally, they view the act of single-sourcing itself as a task with limited focus for TCers, but that could have larger implications on the overall status of TCers within an organization (such as performing knowledge work that affects a company’s bottom line).
However, in order for these implications to come to fruition, TCers and TC researchers have to be able to articulate the benefits of HD et. al.’s definition of CM: those benefits that are not immediately obvious to managers (such as streamlined workflow for single-sourcing, modular authoring, or managing content delivery and maintenance). Instead, TCers and TC researchers must argue and be able to defend the “bigger picture implications,” such as that documentation is a product and reflection of the organization as a whole, much in the way the accounting or applications are. In addition, especially now more than ever, online presence is no longer a byproduct of a company’s products and services, but a representation of that company’s missions and a product/service itself (as was evidenced in the first NPO project profile).
The authors reviewed HD et. al. wonder how CM and single-sourcing will  affect the actual writing expertise required to be a TCer. They also ponder the effect on CM of the growing trend of companies implementing user-generated content, as evidenced by the NPO project, whose main “destination” pages were populated by consumer content. 

<b>Rockley: The Impact of Single Sourcing and Technology</b>
The Rockley article seemed to be a continuation from last week’s theme of redefining audience analysis and user-centered design (UCD) in the context of digitization. In her article, Rockley addresses technological trends in in terms of single-sourcing, information development, and technical communication (TC) as a field. She argues, along with Albers, that technology is gradually decreasing the legitimacy and prevalence of the craftsman model of TC. Single sourcing is receiving more recognition for being the superior information management method because it does not require TCers to waste time manipulating or copy/pasting the same content over and over, it can output to multiple formats, it is easily maintained and updated, and because writers can apply the same content to different audience and contextual needs. 
Rockley explains the 4 “levels” of single sourcing: 1) TCs single source content, but content is formatted/written according to its predicted media, often making it inappropriate/ineffective for multiple audiences and usages. 2) TCs create static “customized” content; they change the “customized” content to fit audience needs and purposes, but they still ultimately construct 1 document at a time. 3) TCs create different information portals that contain different amounts or kinds of information depending on the user who accesses it (via logging in with an established user profile, e.g.). This 3rd level of single-sourcing seems to be akin to the 1st recommendation made by Hart-Davidson et. al. in Project 2 with the MSU library, in which they recommend the library webpage contain “landing pages” for specific, role-based users. 4) TCs create content that changes not only depending on the user who accesses it, but also on the context or actions of the user at any given time (called EPSS). 
Rockley asserts that these technological implications have a positive effects on writers, who will no longer have to “waste time doing mechanical or busy work;” instead, they can perform symbolic-analytic work like “creating new material and creating innovating changes in information delivery” (192). She predicts that TCers will employ more critical thinking and information designing than assembly-line maneuvers. However, (like many articles in TC), this article loses its relevance and/or urgency as it ages. I wonder if any companies are even close to enacting EPSS 13 years after this article’s publication.
