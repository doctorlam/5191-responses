1. 

XML, or Extensible Markup Language, is a language technical communicators, programmers, and other content developers can use to create customizable, genre- and discipline-appropriate metadata tags (hence its extensibility). Aside from a few mechanical rules, writers can create tags that are as unique or specific as necessary for their purposes. 

XML differs from HTML most notably in two ways: 1) XML tags can communicate across authoring platforms and with other languages, and 2) XML tags do not dictate what content will look like, but rather they are descriptive of what each element (or data point) is.

However, certain languages or vocabularies, such as DITA, contain numerous preestablished tags that are genre specific and highly applicable to that field. Although writers are not obligated to use these tags, these vocabularies have been generated because they describe common elements of data sets within that genre. For example, in a MARC catalog, which contains metadata about books, common tags would include author, publisher, illustrator, and genre. Being able to refer to these tags allows writers to achieve consistency among their entries without unnecessarily constraining them.
