Alber's article further explains and explores the various writing positions within a company and offers a glimpse of the career path of the writers. It's interesting to see what kind of responsibilties and skills are required and expected of the writers. One part of Alber's article that grabbed my attention was his description of the junior writer position within a company. Between the text and the chart, it is evident how much of a gap there is from the junior writer to the senior jobs. It illustrates just how much more designing there is in upper management versus writing. Is this necessarily a good thing? Alber explains that, "the production of high-quality documents in a single-sourcing environment requires it." This article and the description of the craftsman model make me think back to classes that have had myself and other students working in groups of a project (a feasability report, for example).These projects have required exstensive work toward the end of the assignment due to a lack of established guidelines by group members before writing and designing each section. Going forward as a technical communicator, these kind of practices will be more common as our positions continue to engage modern technology as it becomes increasingly more integrated into businesses and communication in general.The article reminds readers that single sourcing is a necessity within businesses and organizations, as we've discussed in class. Sucessful content and documents are ones that are easily translatable into multiple formats for various audiences.
