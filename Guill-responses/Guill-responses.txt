The article was extremely helpful in offering insight into what employers are looking for when it comes to hiring technical communicators. Many of the competencies mentioned by managers were not very surprising. However, a few of them that had a lower mean caught me by surprise. The “ability to address new audiences with new technologies” and the “ability to to identify client’s needs” both seemed like skills which should have been mentioned a bit earlier, with higher means attached to them. I thought it seemed peculiar especially since the role that new technologies have taken in the lives to both consumers and the employees working to meet their needs.
In addition to that, I was also interesting to see how low certain digital media abilities were ranked. I believe that some of these skills have certainly increased in value to employers nearly ten years later. Certain aspects like that of this study make it seem a bit dated.
Also, the fact that it mentioned the “ability to understand and be aware of cultural differences” really surprised me. It seems like every job I’ve had to go through video training for always has a section regarding diversity in the workplace. Perhaps this kind of skill isn’t as important in every workplace, or maybe this shows another way in which the workplace has evolved since this paper was written.
