		<h3>Reading Response</h3>
		
		<p>Clark and Anderson are convinced that because technical communicators use technologies such as XML that <q>compel</q> them to understand knowledge management, communicators are in a unique position to understand how technologies add business value. The authors propose that communicators must help their organizations understand that communicators perceive technologies <q>not simply as tools to help end users.</q> The authors argue communicators can do this more realistically if they convince their organizations of their strategic position to add business value. To accomplish this, communicators should focus on two issues central to knowledge management, design and organizational credibility. For Clark and Anderson, design and organization credibility are keys to the sustainability of technical communication.</p>
		
		<p>The authors point out training by academia and practitioners can aid in creating design and organization credibility for communicators. For instance, in academia, students can focus on XML projects that do not <q>solve client-defined problems</q> but <q>problems from a &#133 perspective that would enable communicators to design new, more integrated and sustainable solutions aligned with both organizational and rhetorical goals.</q> Because communicators intimately work with knowledge management and data relationships in XML, the can design sustainable solutions if they have an understanding of business cycles, structures, and goals.</p>
		
		<p>With business acumen, communicators can earn organizational credibility. Clark and Anderson argue that this key to sustainable technical communication can be developed with hybrid learning with academic and industry collaborations. In this type of collaboration, using XML can be key to bridging the needs of the modern technical communicator with that of the modern business. With business acumen, technologies such as XML can first aid communicators to <q>cross boundaries separating them from organizational technology goals and practices,</q> and second XML can help communicators develop innovation and add to the overall business strategy.</p>
