In “Content Management: Beyond Single-Sourcing” William Hart-Davidson changes my perspective on a technical communicator’s role within an organization by framing a description of technical communication in the context of content management. He widens my perspective on technical communication because (1) he traces the common strands of history the field shares with CM, (2) explains how the core expertise of a technical communicator suits the goals of CM, (3) details the expanding roles and responsibilities of technical communicators that involve content strategy, and (4) provides an email from a content analyst, the technical communicator Sonia who describes in her own specialized terminology the complexities of her symbolic-analytic work.
Widening my perspective, Hart-Davidson traces how in the digital era, technical communication has coincided with CM in its need for markup languages and usability; citing late nineties scholars of technical communication, the author provides evidence of the discussion of core structures of modularity, adaptable documents, user environments and other elements that construct CM. Partly, this sharing of influences and developments between technical communication and CM suit technical communicators to the needs of CM: making “information products,” creating and managing information, and designing and managing “workflows and productions models.” This shared history widens my perspective on technical communication because it gives convincing evidence of how the field ties in with CM, and how a technical communicator has the core expertise to adapt successfully to this specific and consuming change in the field.
Hart-Davidson mostly widens my perspective on a technical communicator’s role in an organization by providing a first-hand account of the typical day of a content analyst. In her own words, Sonia recalls her daily tasks that involve electronic pipelines, filter specs, raw data, raw fields, and the occasional “true technical writing.” But her general description of her work is most interesting, and helps widen my perspective of her symbolic-analytical work: “it’s largely logic work … lots to learn … but once learned, continues to be stimulating.”
