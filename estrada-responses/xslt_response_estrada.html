		<h3>Reading Response</h3>
		
		<p>XSLT is an XML language for transforming XML into other formats. XSLT stands for Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, and it specifies rules for transforming XML into formats such as HTML or other text-based documentation formats like PDF. The language is defined by the W3C Recommendations XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0. The language allows you to transform one XML vocabulary into another; for example, you can transform DocBook to XHTML for further processing into PDF. You can transform XML into HTML or XHTML for display in a browser. With XSLT, you can transform XML into a text output such as an RTF format, or you can extract information in the content of XML files into text files. You can format a single XML document in different ways by using different stylesheets to produce output for a specific medium such as the web, print, or for mobile devices.</p>
		
		<p>Creating an XSLT sheet consists of rules on how to use the XML data, because of the way XSLT consists of a set of template rules, these rules can manipulate the source content and customize it for various outputs. In managing content, this type of tool proves to be valuable for technical communicators.</p>
		
		<p>With this flexibility in output, XSLT becomes useful for technical communicators to practice single-sourcing. Part of the flexibility of XSLT relies on XPath. XPath is the language XSLT uses to point to a location, or a node; the XPath expressions locate a set of nodes and return information about the nodes. Useful for technical communicators, XSLT and XPath together can select information and merge multiple stylesheets so that you can combine and reuse stylesheets for different purposes. Finally, because XSLT functions as a flexible and adaptable tool, technical communicators benefit from it by being able to single-source documents, manage content more efficiently, and save their organization time and money.</p>
