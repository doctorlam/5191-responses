		<h3>Reading Response</h3>
		
		<p>Albers contrasts the outdated role of a technical communicator as a craftsman to the current needs of a communicator who must design information for <q>customized access.</q> The author indicates that single-sourcing produces terms of how a technical communicator could develop their career and remain effective, because the communicator's role now <q>revolves around designing and developing dynamic information systems that are tightly integrated with both their underlying system and the user.</q> Single-sourcing also leads Albers to re-imagine the career path of a communicator with a start in a junior position, where you work in order to understand the components of text, the effect of system changes to existing documents, and how to make design decisions. A senior position would plan the documentation, because a senior position understands how <q>to uncover the user's real goals and the information required to address those goals.</q> Albers describes a path that allows for a communicator to become directly involved with how organizations manage, analyze, and design information for the user, a direct link to user satisfaction and profitability.</p>
		
		<p>Albers' career model adds to the ideas and practice of this class, because it adds perspective to digital literacy and the projects the class undertakes. As the class understands how information systems work, we directly practice with them, plan data, create data, and design output for the data. In this regard, the class facilitates the knowledge work a communicator would do in the beginning of their career. The class directly prepares us for a career of symbolic-analytic work, work that gives promise for a career of exciting, engaging work that adds value to both the communicator and the organization. The article and class add to my perspective on my future career by seeing how understanding the management of information is critical for me and the future of the field.</p>
