	The Rainey and Dayton article features technology competencies extracted from 10 university curriculum standards that are then analyzed through a rating survey by “a broad-based sample” of technical communicator managers. In light of the managerial ratings, the most surprising features of the research include the emphasis of collaborative over technology skills, and the emphasis of self-activation or self-evaluation competencies. 
	Again, the extracted competencies from university curricula feature a surprising emphasis on technology; out of the 63 competencies extracted from the curricula, more than 30 feature a technology skill, more than 15 feature a writing or design skill, and only a handful feature a collaborative or self-activation skill. Because both the ability of collaboration with subject-matter experts and the ability of collaboration with co-workers were ranked the two most important skills of a technical communicator, it is surprising that most of the competencies featured are based on technology and writing. Perhaps this discrepancy is based on the lack of collaboration between the technical communication curricula and the business curricula? Or maybe it should be no surprise that technical communicators are needed by their managers to be more collaborative, because of the fact that universities do not emphasize this competency enough in the curricula.
	Elaborated by the survey's open-ended responses and also the post-survey interviews, another surprise is that self-activation skills are highly marketable. One manager stresses a need for emotional maturity, the ability to take criticism, and she notes that “core competencies … are more about real-world personal skill sets.” So what is or can be in a curriculum that develops these competencies? It could be that this group of competencies can be obtained in a rigorous program that emphasizes the type of student collaboration that mimics the collaboration of the business world, where under deadlines, technical communicators must communicate with others from a variety of backgrounds and experiences to complete a project.
