		<h3>Reading Response</h3>
		
		<p>Ann Rockley argues that single sourcing redefines the technical communicator and changes the impact a technical communicator can have in an organization. The author defines 4 levels of single sourcing that require different roles and ways of thinking for organizations and their content management systems. Each level of single sourcing entails a more focused use of information in how a user interacts with the content, whether to complete a task or use a product. The process of Rockley's vision of single-sourcing includes a team approach consisting of writers of content, editors of content, information technologists who design information structures, and information architects who create and guide the workflow. </p>
		
		<p><i>Coming to Content Management: Inventing Infrastructure for Organizational Knowledge Work,</i> has authors who examine the implementation of content management in two cases. In the process of one organization's goal to create a better website, much of Rockley's single sourcing theories come to life in the companies task to tailor information or share content on their website to their different clients. The task is a team effort with teams that work to create a better sense of content types.</p>
