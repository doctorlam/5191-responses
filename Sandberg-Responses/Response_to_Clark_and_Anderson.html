            <p>Clark and Anderson say that technologies like XML have limited technical communicators. These technologies limit technical communicators because the technical communicators start to think in terms of keeping up with the technology. Clark and Anderson review the STC journals and find that many of them are focused on things like writing XML documentation. This focus doesn’t allow technical communicators to focus on how the technology could affect the organization at large. Clark and Anderson also argue that technical communicators are in a perfect position to make recommendations and understand how the technology will affect the business, but instead technical communicators limit themselves. Technical communicators focus on client or project goals rather than seeing the bigger picture and the overall organizational goals. To create a more sustainable technical communication, technical communicators should position themselves to not only use the new technologies but help their organizations understand how the technology will affect the organization as a whole. In academics, technical communicators can make contact with other fields that are more concerned with industry and focus more on organizational goals. They can also write in other journals outside of technical communication and read literature in related fields as well. If technical communicators can’t adopt a larger organizational perspective, then they will always have to adapt to new technologies and will be seen as tool jockeys. If the organization views technical communicators as tool jockeys, then the organization might look to other fields to fill these positions. If technical communicators can show how their other skills can bring more value to an organization, they can gain more organizational clout. Clark and Anderson end with some recommendations. They mention IBM’s mentor program, which forces mentored workers to learn the business before they start to work with the more technology heavy aspect of the job. This ensures that new workers have a good understanding of the business and the technology that they will be using. </p>
