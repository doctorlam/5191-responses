<h1>Albers, Michael J. “Single Sourcing and the Technical Communication Career Path.” Technical Communication 50 (3). 2003. Pp. 335-344. </h1>
<p>This article delineated the roles of both senior and junior technical writers. This distinction changed my mind about 
what constitutes and senior Technical Writer. I thought the difference was something like more time spent on the job. 
However, the article distinguished the two by showing the different responsibilities, both currently (2003) and in the
future. I hadn’t ever thought about a career path as hierarchical, but the article certainly showed these different 
responsibilities, even if they were only predictions for the future. The article also discussed the different senior 
level position that writers could have. The article put Information analyst, information designer, information 
architect, and information technologist all on the same level. Usually, these are discussed separately, but the article 
showed the differences in the career paths by putting them altogether. The article also changed my perspective on the 
class when it said that single-sourcing can be used to create two different documents, one for a novice user and one 
for an experienced user. I had thought of creating content in terms of different audiences, but I hadn’t thought in 
terms of making it because a particular audience requested it. We can create more advanced user material for a more 
experienced user and less advanced material for a novice, and that idea strengthens the importance of XML. The article 
also showed how more modularized writing can create problems in larger web pages. It compared writers under the 
craftsman model and under a single sourced model. Previously, one writer wouldn’t have to worry about their content 
being juxtaposed closely with another writers, but in XML this juxtaposition may occur often. The quality of the 
writing will suffer and prevent the end user from getting to important information. I thought this also strengthened 
the importance of XML in technical communication, but it also made me think about the more global issues that XML 
brings to writing.</p>
