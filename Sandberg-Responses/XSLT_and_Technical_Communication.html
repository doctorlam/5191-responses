			<p>Technical Communicators can use XSLT style sheets to transform XML documents for 
			different audiences. Technical Communicators can create PDFs 
			and websites using XSLT and XML. With these different outputs, Technical 
			Communicators can tailor these documents to these audiences. 
			They can select what information to show to one 
			audience. They can also choose to omit information if the 
			audience wouldn’t be interested in that information. The 
			different formats provide the audience with the correct 
			information in a way that the audience prefers. XSLT also 
			allows Technical Communicators to use the same information
			throughout different documents. They can update the XML 
			document and the XSLT files will transform that document to the 
			outputs that are needed. This keeps all the information 
			consistent across different formats and, if an organization 
			implements XML, throughout the organization. Although Technical 
			Communicators use XSLT to style XML, XSLT is XML. It is also 
			compatible with several other technologies. Technical Communicators 
			can weave other markup languages, such as HTML, into their 
			XSLT and use that when producing the appropriate output. 
			Technical Communicators can then style the HTML with CSS. 
			Because XSLT has this compatibility, Technical Communicators can
			use it to put other types of files within the output. XML wouldn't
			allow jpg's and other image files by themselves, but Technical
			Communicators can use the XSLT file to incorporate these other 
			documents with their XML to produce the final output. Without XSLT, Technical 
			Communicators couldn't format and produce the multiple documents that they must make from the
			XML document. XSLT makes XML versatile and lets Technical
			Communicators deploy the same information across multiple
			formats in multiple documents for different audiences. </p>
