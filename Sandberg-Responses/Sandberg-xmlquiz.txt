1. What is XML and what is its purpose? (Write your response inside of this text file)

XML is Extensible Markup Language. It is used in single sourcing to make repositories. XML
is useful because computers and humans can read the tags. It also allows tags to be created as needed,
so companies in different industries can create the tags that are specific to that industry. XML 
documents can also be used to create several outputs, including web pages and pdfs. Multiple authors 
can also collaborate to create these documents. XML is also a recommendation of the World Wide Web
Consortium. A XML can also put into a xhtml to create web pages.
