Response to the Rainey, Turner, and Dayton Article
I thought the most interesting findings of the article were that managers say 44% of the demand for their information products comes from an international audience, that managers were looking for self-evaluation from potential candidates, and that some scholars have argued that technical communicators are well suited to analyze the requirements for software. For technical communicators to write to an international audience, they must understand how to write for translation, globalization, and localization. Technical communicators should understand how this will affect the documents that they produce and the requirements for those documents. Also, they must understand how an international audience changes how the audience analysis can be performed. With 44% of managers reporting international demand for their products, the article could have recommended that universities create classes that investigate this key component. I wanted to see more about how technical communicators can create web sites that respond to international audiences. I thought that managers look for self-evaluation was interesting. I’m not sure how you would teach that within a classroom without having critiques and evaluations when working within groups. The authors grouped this ability with the ability to be a self-starter, and I wonder if it would have ranked so high if the authors had separated these two qualities. I think most jobs require the ability to take the initiative and some even include it in the job description, but most job ads don’t list self-evaluation explicitly. The article also discussed requirements analysis. Managers want technical communicators who can learn new technology quickly, and they would have to be able to pick up the software quickly if they are to create the requirements for what it must do. I would think that creating the requirements analysis for software requires technical communicators to know the limitations of the technology or system that they are working with. I would have liked the article to explore these findings in more detail and consider their implications for technical communication departments, but the authors do admit that the sample was based on voluntary responses and may not have reflected the field more broadly.
