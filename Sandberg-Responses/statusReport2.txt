I created an XML document that meets all the requirements. It has an XSL file and a CSS file 
that are properly linked. They work together in Firefox. The XML document lists all of the books 
that I have with their authors, publishers, dates, titles, condition, and the first sentence of 
each book. I tagged the XML document so I could put it into different formats, including APA, 
MLA, and Chicago. This gives me options when I display the final output for different users. I 
can put these into a searchable format that gives the viewer some options. For example, I can 
use style guides to create an output that automatically lists the citation for each book. I can 
also use the first sentence to give the end user some idea of what the book is about. This 
could help someone decide if they want to read the book. The books from technical communication 
are usually direct. They often state, "This book describes," or some variation. However, the 
fiction books often start with a line that is intriguing, but doesn't summarize the book. These 
books might include a synopsis to give the user a better understanding of what the book is about. 
I could also create another tag to describe if the book is fiction or non-fiction. Currently, 
I’m trying to transform the file into html so that multiple browsers can display the information. 
However, different sources approach this task differently. One source even described what I 
already have. I’m also exploring way to transform the final output into different formats to 
give the user options.  

Do MLA, APA, and Chicago cite books in ways that are different enough that someone would want to
use the XML to return a citation in these formats?
Should there be a different tag with a synopsis of each book?
