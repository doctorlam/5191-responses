The Hart-Davidson article altered my view in several ways. The article changed the title
that I thought a technical communicator would have within an organization. I thought it showed 
where the field was going when the person that he interviewed wasn't a technical writer, but held
the title of Content Analyst. I had  never heard of a content analyst, and I don't think I
would've applied to a job with that title. The article also makes the observation that the technical writers
role is required in the information age, but it seems to be critical about the future
of technical communication. It both champions technical writers in more managerial positions
while noting that organizations might be outsourced in the future. It lists the categories for managing and making content: making texts,
creating and managing information sets, and designing and managing workflows and production models. 
This dividion surprised me because it makes managing a central feature of two categories. Because 
the article stresses the importance of information to companies and makes management key in the technical 
writer's function, it positions technical writers as managers in their organizations. However, 
it also notes that writing will be outsourced with many writers contributing from overseas. It also mentions
that Web 2.0 has changed who contributes, from the writers to the actual users of the product and the
content contained in the help information. The article also changed my views about 
what content management means. I was especially surprised when the artice discussed Bush's article 
in the context of predicting that information would one day be the most important thing, but managing it
would be important because there would be so much of it. Although the general tone of the article was critical
about the future of technical communication, it also placed technical writers at a crucial position within their
organizations.
