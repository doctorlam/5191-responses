	<p>XSLT is an acronym for Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations. According to Cowan, XSLT "is an XML language that specifies rules for transforming XML into another format, the rules being supplied in an XSLT style sheet that is associated with an XML document" (Cowan, 148). XSLT can be used to transform a multitude of documents, but what is really useful is that you are not changing the original documents. </p>
	<p> Not only is XSLT useful for transforming "formats: it has powerful facilities for manipulating the source content and customizing the output" (Cowan, 149). This is important because it allows technical communicators to create documents for multiple formats (single sourcing). By only having to write something once, the writer will not only be able to save time, but they will be able to focus more on content, usability for the user, and consistency. If the writer is consistently having to recreate the same document, they may not rewrite the exact same way each time therefore that could cost a company money and create more problems than it would solve. By using XSLT, the technical writer can create the document once and then transform it to another format.  With saving time, the technical writer would also be saving the company money because the technical writer would be able to produce a document in a shorter amount of time. Of course it could be said that we are shooting ourselves in the foot by using XSLT and cutting our work hours, but that is time that could be used learning another concept within our field. Like we discussed last week, the field of technical communication is very narrow when we adopt the technology as tools concept. By using XSLT, technical communicators are making the creation of documents easier and it frees up some room for us to immerse ourselves in new concepts in our field. XSLT is a tool that allows us to transforms documents between formats, but it can also show employers that we are much more than just writers. </p>
