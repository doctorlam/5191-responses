Free Response to The Impact of Single Sourcing and Technology.

This is probably the most frustrated I have been by reading an article. Not so much from my understanding of the content, but the fact that there are so many positive outcomes to single sourcing and yet it is not widely practiced in our field. I swear, I feel like I am talking to my dad and trying to convince him to see a doctor. I understand that it is hard for people who have done the same routine for the last 20+ years to change, but when there is so many positive outcomes then why not incorporate this more? The wheel wasn’t made perfect the first time, so why can’t older generation of technical communicators realize that our field is evolving. The field keeps handing us a hammer and we still choose the rock. This is the perfect time to adopt some new ways to better our quality of work and to solidify our positions within organizations. In the 1980’s is when it was no longer okay to just be good writers so why are we still trying to fight the change that is obviously going to come? No longer are we going to be in solidarity in our dusty cubicles, we will now be a part of a team! By adopting the team approach, we will better able to serve our customers and analyze the effectiveness of our documents. As Rockley discusses, the team approach will have the writers, information designers, editors, and information technologists. As previously discussed, we are currently adopting the technology as tool mindset and creating this tunnel vision as far as what our responsibilities are. By adopting single sourcing, we will “increasing the scope” of what writers actually do (192). How can people not see that this will be adding value to our titles and increase our job security.  I don’t know about you, but I am definitely taking single sourcing very seriously.
