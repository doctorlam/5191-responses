<h1>Response to Clark and Anderson Article</h1>
<body>
<p1>Clark and Anderson's participation in a graduate level independent study course exploring knowledge management brought them to conclude that one of the main reasons that we, as technical communicators, are undervalued in our respected organizations is because of the concept "Technology as a tool".  This outlook has severely limited technical communicators in the sense that we have been separated from other portions of the organization that could include more of the design and business aspects of it as Nardi and O’Day have stated in their research. As a result, we have earned the title of “tool jockeys”.  However, Wick, Rockley, and Applen suggest “Technical communicators who wish to increase their organization status must move in the opposite direction, coming to see technologies not simply as tools to help end users and internal customers, but as a part of a larger organizational strategies” (291).  Two major problems with the technology as a tool concept is there is limited design credibility and a lack of organizational credibility.  Despite being chumped together with software developers and being seen only as cubicle monkeys, technical communicators can bring value to their organizations by immersing themselves in “expanding their territory into the realm of knowledge management by learning how to model knowledge by using XML” (Applen, 307). By expanding our ability to manage such information using tools that other professionals use, we are able to create a better way to present information for not just internal usage, but for external usage as well. In order to do such a thing, a better understanding of how decisions are made as far as business and design wise, a better grasps of those concepts are needed. Programs of technical communication, at both the undergraduate and graduate level, should be more interdisciplinary. By exposing students to business, computer science, and even other fields, we are able to see a 360 view of what we are doing and how it impacts the organization. By encompassing the technology as a tool view, we are narrowing our sight to a mere 180 degrees. We will not be getting the entire picture. Rather than focusing on teaching specific programs such as Madcap Flare and others, by focusing on XML, students will be able to reach out to more professionals. It makes us more valuable, because not only are we able to write, but we are also able to assist in the design and decision making processes.
