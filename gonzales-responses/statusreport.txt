So far everything is going ok. The only thing I am having an issue with is finding an error in my XML file. I have tried to make the second column work, but when I submit the file in the code validator it tells me that my tags are mismatched. I went in to edit it, but I still get the same error so my second column wont show up. I will figure this out. I think it might be best for me to start fresh with the original file of the one working column so i can pinpoint exactly where I messed up. I am seriously considering getting a rubber duck to explain my code to. Other than that, everything is going okay. I am trying to decide whether or not to reconsider some of my table categories. Although there is nothing wrong with my categories, I am just rethinking its efficiency if a group were to have access to this table, would it make sense to have a category with a key signature? As a mariachi, you are expected to be able transpose to another key on the spot so having a category with a key signature might not be the best idea. The only real question I have is how would I put an Ã± in the table without it telling me its an error? Is there a particular way to code it?
