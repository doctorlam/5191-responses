Albers's brings up a lot of valid points in his article "Single Sourcing and Technical Communication Career Path". Yes, technical communicators are expected to have a wide range of skills to be able to complete the task at hand, but it goes beyond that. Albers has an interesting way of breaking down the future responsibilities of technical communicators, "Jack of all Trades or Master of None". Yes, the master will be "asked to the meetings that decide the strategic approaches and define company views of what type of knowledge should be disseminated and how should it be presented" (338). Honestly, I believe that the future is going to be mixed. There will be those who specialize in user analysis, usability, or whatever have it, but they will have to start off as a jack. In order to do the tasks that a master is expected to do, the technical communicator must first be able to do the basics. Why can't we be both? I see it as a pyramid, you must be sufficient at each level in order to move to the very top. Some may argue that yes we are moving towards a more engineered document rather than one that is organically written, but are those claim this really thinking of efficieny? I see the need to be well versed in everything within this field in order to do a job well. Also, this field needs to be more interdisciplinary depending on what career goals the technical communicator has. For example, I am not going into the technical communication field completely, I am going into public health. As an epidemiologist, one who studies the transmission of diseases and offers pretentative measures, I see the need to be able to effectively communicate across multiple mediums. I am going to have to break down complex scientific ideas in a way that the general public would have to understand. Therefore, I need to be well trained in technical communication in order to be effective at my job. I see how technical communication is in every field out there. It's principles can be found in just about every specialization out there. I really do wish that more people would see the value of the emerging field.
