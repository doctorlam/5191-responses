Hart-Davidson definitely brought up many good points in the article "Content Management, Beyond Single-Sourcing". The most interesting analogy was that technical writers, if we can still be called that, "are textual air traffic controllers, helping to make sure a host of projects take off and land safely, efficiently, and effectively" (129). Before reading this article, I did not really see a difference between content managers and technical writers, now I see a small difference. However, both essentially work hand in hand and are the same person. There were two key trends that occurred that made content management more common for technical communicators: 1. Advances in networked information technology and 2. Shift toward global information economy. Often times, technical writers take an already written and edit it in a way that presents the information in the best light.  Hart-Davidson reiterates the point that “We are merely not writers any more. Now we are editors, information architects, usability analysts, interaction designers, project managers, client liaisons, and more “(135).  The way I have been seeing the responsibility of technical communicators since the start of the semester has changed from what I had previously thought. Essentially, we are Ditto (yes this is a Pokemon reference). Technical Communicators, like Ditto, have to reshape and take form of whatever is expected of us by the workforce. We transform into what either the audience base, company, management expects from us. However, depending on the amount of leeway given, we do not necessarily alter what is done. This idea is supported by an article titled “The File Cabinet has a Sex Life” by Lee Clark Johns. The same way Ditto is able to mirror what is in front of him, but it looks slightly different, that is what is expected of us as technical communicators.
