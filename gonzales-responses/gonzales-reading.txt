Response to Rainey/Dayton/Turner Article

The question raised in the article "Do curricula correspond to managerial expectations?" is a very interesting one. Although many would like to believe that the current program in which they are enrolled in is the "best" it may not provide them with the necessary tools in order to complete the job. The concept that you cannot build a house without the foundation seems to be one that hiring managers have taken to heart. Rainey/Dayton/Turner found interesting from the survey results was “the emphasis that the respondents place on collaboration as an essential competency, even slightly ahead of clear and competent writing in their mean rankings” (10). However, I did not find that completely surprising. If you think about it, if someone does not have enough intrapersonal skills to collaborate with others on a project, how can you truly expect them to be able to understand the needs of their audience? If they are unwilling or unable to speak to a client to figure out their needs, how would they be able to properly cater the document? I can understand why Minniti, Brown, and Giamnona would more than likely hire someone with excellent collaboration skills, but with average technical skills, because technical skills unlike intrapersonal skills, can be taught. The hiring managers that were interviewed on a personal level concluded that “they want competent writers with collaborative and people skills who they can train in specific software tools” (11). On the other hand, the unbiased reflection portion of the study showed that they want a candidate to be “familiar with the basic tools of the trade” which would include Microsoft Office, Framemaker, and HTML/XML (3). What a student needs is to be “a superb writer who understands technology and works well with others” (11) Understanding technology is the basics to provide that foundation for employers to build on.
