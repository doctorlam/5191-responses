Update on Project 2Current StatusCurrently, I have an XML and an XSLT document. The format for the XML document is laid out and validated at its current state. I still need to add more recipe entries, but there shouldn't be any issue with inserting those entriesMy XSLT document is linked to my XML document, but the contents is sparse. I have a plan of how to organize my XML information by using headings to list the names of the recipes and unordered lists to organize the rest of my information.Future PlansOnce I finish adding the rest of my XML entries, I plan to organize the entries in the XSLT file using headings and unordered lists. If time provides, I will use JavaScript to make parts of the table appear and disappear to keep the data streamlined and organized. I will also apply CSS to change the table design so it is easy to read and aesthetically appealing.I assess that I still have much work to do, but I am confident that I can complete the project by next Monday.
