The article makes complete sense of why this class is a core course in our program since even senior technical communicators consider XML and single sourcing vitally important. We also need the ability to write very well as our most basic jobs when we enter the industry are purely writing jobs. The 5191 course teaches us to be Information Technologists, which is a senior level position as technical writers. The article makes perfect sense about what happens in the industry and how our course is designed towards what the industry wants from its new hires. 
Another important skill that this course needs to teach us, according to what I gleaned from the article, is the ability to self-learn various skills in order to justify our value to our employers. The most important amongst these is an ability to analyze what the users’ needs are, what content is important, the metadata that needs to be implemented, and a variety of other skills.
The article talks about how our future as technical communicators means that we should ensure that the organization that hires us finds our skills invaluable and indispensable. Albers says that our final career goal in the industry should not be to be a manager, but to try and be a senior technical writer. Single sourcing is what is regarded as the future for technical communicators and that is exactly what we are being taught in this course.
