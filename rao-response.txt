There have been a lot of surprising findings in the Rainey and Dayton articles, particularly regarding technological competencies and the focus on managerial competencies. The article talks about the competencies managers felt new hires should have when being interviewed, what is lacking in the current curricula for Technical Communication programs, and the scope for technical communication jobs in the future.
The first sample, the survey of managers presented the more surprising findings. According to the survey, the understanding of/affinity for technology was very lowly ranked by many working in the industry. This is surprising considering how often technical communicators have to work seamlessly with technical products. Managers considered the skill of knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite to be very important, but that can be understood if these jobs involve lots of presentations, writing documents and making budgets.
What is more shocking is that inter-office collaboration outranks the ability to assess and to learn to use technology. This is shocking because the most basic job of a technical writer/communicator involves the assessment of technology.
Jobs like these also seem to have less focus on the actual knowledge of page design software, since most might consider the ability to design pages as important as the content in the pages. The ability to use single sourcing and the ability to use digital cameras are also ranked quite lowly, which is surprising because digital cameras can help record things more effectively and single sourcing is required in this age of international affairs.
The second sample, the interview with the managers has reinforced some of the beliefs of the survey, but some of their beliefs have gone against the more general survey. These managers believed that real world skills were more important than technological ones, which would make sense if these people intended to be part of management one day. Ability to learn new technology, enthusiasm about technology and competency in writing were some of the most required assets for new hires, according to them.
