<h1>Clark and Anderson Response</h1>
<p>Clark and Anderson examine technology through the “technology as tools” approach,
wondering if this approach is broad enough. The problem, they believe, is that technical communicators are not involved
enough in the design of technologies, and are instead relegated to the role of “tool jockey,” meaning that they have no say in
how these technologies are created, but instead are seen as master end-users of these technologies. The problem is that technical
communicators cannot apply any theory to the design of new technologies because they are generally barred from the design process.
They argue that thinking of technologies as tools exclusively is detrimental, and that technical communicators must take a broader
approach in order to be taken more seriously in the workplace.

Their main argument is that technical communicators can’t hide in their cubicles anymore, and that they have to show their employers
that they care about the bottom line and the business as a whole, an “entrepreneurial understanding” of technical communication. XML
fits into this notion of sustainable technical communication in that XML and similar technologies can affect the bottom line, whether
by reducing cost or adding value to a product. What technical communicators have to do is communicate that value to management and further
communicate that they can help shape the role of future technologies like XML. Nor can we focus on technologies that affect only the
end user. As Clark and Andersen say, we must consider how development of technologies fit into overall business strategies, and we must
think about how the technologies we help develop can create value for the business itself. While XML may force technical communicators to
learn more about the organizations they work for, this knowledge alone is insufficient. Technical communicators can only apply this
knowledge if management lets them, so the first job of technical communicators is to persuade management of our knowledge of the
organization, and further, of our ability to participate in other areas of the organization.
