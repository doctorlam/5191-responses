Albers’ article is made me think about specialization in a very different way than we have been discussing it in class.
When we have been talking about specialization, we generally mean some sort of industry specialization like marketing, aeronautics,
or programming; however, Albers is talking about a very different kind of specialization: a specialization in terms of information handling.
I sometimes find myself frustrated that the undergraduate program here did not have explicit specialization paths, but one thing that I could
foresee our program keeping, even with specialization paths, is this focus on general abilities. Everyone is basically expected to know
everything about technical communication, and I don’t see that changing if suddenly I could specialize in marketing. I would still be expected
to know how to do design and writing and web development. I think the same applies to the master’s program, and to this class. We aren’t told,
“You can specialize in creating DTD’s or XSLT,” but instead are told, “You have to learn it all.” After reading this article, I have to wonder
how effective that is.

In terms of my future, I have always known that I needed to specialize. I have friends who are technical communicators who are
jacks-of-all-trades, and they aren’t exactly happy about it. Part of the difficulty is that I have to choose a series of specializations.
I have to choose an industry (tech) and a type of writing (comm), but this article is saying I have to choose a subcategory of writing, and I
wonder how well that would play out. Every industry is different, and I may find myself in an industry where, like Albers himself points out,
I may be one of two technical writers. I may not have a choice. Still, to be truly effective, I need to be a master of something that no one
else is, and it cannot be simply writing.
