<h1>XSLT response</h1>
<p>XSLT stands for extensible stylesheet language transformations, and it is a programming language that transforms XML documents into
other XML documents or into a variety of different outputs, including HTML, text files, and PDFs. XSLT also allows one to style and XML
document, much in the same way CSS is used to style an html document. XSLT makes XML extraordinarily useful and makes single sourcing
through XML possible.</p>

<p>XSLT is useful for technical communicators because it is what really makes single sourcing with XML possible.
Without XSLT, an XML document cannot do a whole lot, but with XSLT, a technical communicator can store all of his or her
content in one XML document and use XSLT documents to transform the single XML source into any sort of output that technical
communicator might desire. XSLT can save technical communicators a great deal of time by saving a technical communicator from
having to individually create, say, a PDF and a web page from the same content. The viability of single sourcing through XML is
really made possible with XSLT.</p>

<p>XSLT can also save time, and money, by allowing a technical communicator to change outputs by manipulating one XSLT document
to output into a new type of document, say a brochure, without having to create the entire brochure in a separate piece of proprietary
software. The fact that XML and XSLT both work as text documents and do not require proprietary software makes XSLT a real option for
businesses who cannot afford expensive proprietary software.</p>

<p>Finally, because XSLT is a separate document from the XML document it styles and transforms, XSLT saves money for a technical
communicator when he or she needs to change the content in the original XML document. The XSLT document doesn’t have to change at
all unless the technical communicator changes the tags in the XML document, thus further reducing time spent doing something other
than creating format.
