1. What is XML and what is its purpose? (Write your response inside of this text file)
XML is a markup language similar to HTML. XML stands for extensible markup language, and it is basically a markup language that can use
any tag that a user defines. The purpose of XML is to separate content from formatting, so a marked up document can be put into a series
of applications to produce a series of outputs without changing the content. The markup tells each application what the data is and how
it should be formatted.
