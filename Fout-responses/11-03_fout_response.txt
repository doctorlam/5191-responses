Ann Rockley’s article really got me thinking about the role of big data in technical communication with regards to the fourth level of single sourcing: EPSS. I think that such a system with “just in time” information is only possible with big data, but I also think Rockley considers a system like this in a very limited sense, as though it would only apply within a specific program like Adobe Illustrator, rather than over an entire computer. The line that strikes me the most is the following: “the system can determine what information users need to know at any point in time.” What if this system cataloged everything a user does on their computer, or their smart phone, or their TV, or all of the above? Such a system would have to rely on a great deal of information about a user, ideally all available information about a user, and such a system could work by analyzing everything a user does while at his or her device or devices. The scope would include information as large as common searches on search engines to information as small as hesitations in mouse movements within specific programs. The system would have to constantly monitor all these things in order to predict what a user needs and then recommend a solution. The definition of “needs” and “solution” would have to be very broad. Such a system sounds like an artificial intelligence, and it may not be too far off in the future.The second article was less thought provoking, but I really liked the idea of thinking of content management as a type of conduct rather than a system that a company implements. The idea that a company has to change the way they do everything by applying the principle of content management is a great idea, and I think that technical communicators really have to think differently about content management in order to understand it. We can’t just look at it as another piece of software.
