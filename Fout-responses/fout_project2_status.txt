The XML project is coming along fine, and I should have no trouble staying on schedule and completing the project by October 27th.
At this point, I am ready to create a .css file to style my table, but my XSLT seems to be working just fine.
I had some trouble with one element that I had nested within another element. I had series nested within publisher, like so:

  <game>
        <console>Xbox 360</console>
        <publisher>Ubisoft<series>Assassin's Creed</series></publisher>
        <game_title>Assassin's Creed Revelations</game_title>
        <single_multi>single and multi</single_multi>
        <genre>open-world</genre>
        <subgenre>stealth</subgenre>
        <rating>mature</rating>
    </game>
    
When I structured the XSLT to pull publisher with the value-of function, it pulled the series as well, so my question is this: how do I get
value-of to ignore the series? Similarly, my next column did not pull anything when set to <xsl:value-of select="series"/>.
The parent/child relationship has always been difficult for me to understand conceptually, so how do I make this work in practice, other
than simply taking <series> out of publisher?
