Adam Fout response to Hart-Davidson article: Hart-Davidson continues in the vein of other writers that we have read this semester when he says that technical communicators must be more than simply writers. He does this through the lens of content management, suggesting that technical communicators must be gardeners in a textual (content) ecosystem. I am already becoming convinced of this idea of the technical communicator as content manager/curator, and this article pushed me still further towards this altered notion of the role of a technical communicator.Although I can imagine how some technical communicators who are still stuck in the mindset of “we are writers” would chaff at the thought of being anything other than a writer, I see this as a wonderful opportunity because it positions technical communicators to take on supervisory roles, as Hart-Davidson suggests (p.138). Supervisory and management roles are not only higher paid and more valued roles, but they are also roles where employees engage in knowledge work. The higher value means better job security and pay, but the knowledge work means more interesting and engaging work. These are also roles that can’t be cut at the first sign of trouble in an organization, something that can’t be said for the technical writer position.Hart-Davidson also clearly addresses a concern of mine: that user-generated content could lead technical writers right out of a job. Although it may very well do so for technical writers, Hart-Davidson has convinced me that, as a gardener, my job could be to make sure the various weeds that user-generated content inevitably creates don’t choke the rest of the garden. User-generated content, therefore, provides me not with obstacles, but rather with opportunities.The email from the content analyst was particularly enlightening as it showed that my role doesn’t have to have anything to do with content creation at all. Instead, I can manage the content in a variety of different ways, which opens up many different opportunities for me as a technical communicator. This article has helped me realize that my role in an organization can be quite valuable without creating any kind of content thanks to content management technology.
