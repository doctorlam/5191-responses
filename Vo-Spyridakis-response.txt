It can be inferred from many recent researches, conferences and readings about Technical Communication (TC) that the field is emerging and changing. A lot more skills, knowledge, techniques and competencies are listed our to be some new requirements for people working as technical communicators or writers. 
In the paper “Identifying New Topics in TC Curricular: Preparing Students for Success in a Changing World”, Jan h. Spyridakis has brought about some important points about the topics should be incorporated in TC programs in order to get TC students fully prepared for the professional working environment. Three main ideas on the paper were: the traditional foundational TC skills, including rhetoric, writing, editing, and design, are still fundamental; other new topics to be brought in are genres, management and collaboration, design, user experience (UX), methods, programming, and tools; and real-world projects relating to internships, client and service based learning should be integrated as well. Spyridakis also proved the trend by some survey results in 2014 of 15 TC programs. They showed that client and service based, tracks, and internship opportunities were all available for students. Some few programs also offered genres, methods design and UX, international communication, and ethics. Even though the number is still small, there is no doubt that they can get expanded to catch the trend of the field. Next, Spyridakis continued discussing on the core competencies to be taught to TC students. There is one crucial point to pay attention to: User experience design (UX) jobs and chances. From the paper, it can be in formed that the job is getting bigger as a person having skills in UX is more versatile than a TC that does not have them. Since the practices in UX are related to TC, this is a real opportunity for all graduates in TC to have a wider scale of career. In the mass competitive work market, a person having two skills plus knowledge is always a better choice than a person who is not as customized and varied. This is a really great point that the author pointed out in the paper, and once again reminded all TC programs to have serious thoughts on offering UX. The thing that the TC programs should do upon this topic is having their eyes on the job market and getting themselves update constantly about the job opportunities available for UX, to see whether the trend is real and worth investing on. This also brings this response to next or the final point in the paper. Spyridakis emphasized that any change to TC programs mist be considered thoroughly under a lot of conditions and terms and information. This is another vital point for every single TC programs to be aware of. For instance, it can be a trendy thing to have TC graduates acknowledged about UX working as a UX specialists in New York, which makes it decisive to incorporate the skills in teaching over there, which does not reflect the real trend happening in California. 
When this reading is compared with other readings recently, a lot of similarities can be pointed out. It is undeniable that the mutual trend of the TC world is toward the change from paper media to online media and everything related to it. Her findings also cited an opinion on the importance of collaboration with subject-matter experts, as well as the ability to learn more skills rather than having only one specific set of skills.  All the readings really help shape the real state of TC, so that all people working on the field can really understand what to prepare and how to develop. However, her findings did add some exclusive points toward the education of TC at the moment. All the advice given to TC programs really weight in this reading, which makes it valuable and substantial for not only the managers of the programs but also students.
