In their article, Clark and Anderson advocate a switch in the technical communication on how tools and technology are used. Currently, the main practice for technical communicators is technology as tools. This idea is that technical communicators view technology simply as a tool to help the end users and internal customers. Instead of using this vain of thought, TC’s need to think in the opposite direction. Because TC’s are prone to thinking in this way, it opens up problems such as limited design credibility and a lack of organizational credibility. 

Clark and Anderson state that technical communicators need to think of the end users but also the organization where they work. Instead of focusing on the technology, TC’s need to broaden their knowledge about the business and the management that goes with the company. XML is one of the tools mentioned that may be able to give technical communicators this insight. XML allows a technical communicator the ability to broaden their tunnel vision from simply the tools to include the company’s problems. 

In the end, Clark and Anderson suggest technical communicators start learning these new avenues of thinking. By keeping practitioners from having tunnel vision on the tools they use, they can better understand the business perspective. I think that this way of thinking can also relieve a lot of tension and missed communications in the workplace. When everyone is on the same page and has the same goals, there are fewer grumpy workers.
