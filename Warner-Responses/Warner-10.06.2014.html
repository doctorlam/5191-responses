		<body>XSLT is an XML language that specifies the rules in an associated stylesheet necessary for transforming XML documents into other formats, including HTML and other XML vocabularies. XSLT allows you to create multiple style sheets to later apply to your XML document for different outputs such as web, print, and mobile devices. 

		You can also rearrange information, generate glossaries, create tables of contents and several other functions. XSLT also uses XPath to search or manipulate your XML document using particular nodes. XPath can point to different locations in the parsed XML document (just like styles in Word, but on a far more specific level). XSL-FO can further the the XSLT stylesheet by describing page layouts. This defines page sizes, margins, and the sequences of pages. This adds a final touch to your documents.  

		XSL languages are behind a lot of the tools, especially publishing tools that technical communicators use on a daily basis. It is a difficult language to learn and isnâ€™t going to always be necessary for a technical communicator to use. What is valuable is the knowledge of how the process works and what it is used for. To understand the code and language that go on behind the tools and software that are used, will be valuable. This is especially true if technical communicators find themselves working with software developers. Being able to understand what developers are saying and being able to comprehend the work that they do will help technical communicators remain an asset in the workplace.
