Hart’s article actually reinforced a lot of the information that I’ve been finding out about the technical communication field. Technical communicators are taking on more and more responsibilities and the field itself is changing constantly. I believe that Hart’s point that instead of scoffing at Content Management, technical communicators should have more involvement in the process. This article did bring up the question in my mind, is content management and technical communication eventually going to merge into one umbrella job title?

A troubling portion of Hart’s article was the mention that everyone in an organization needs to write well and be able to communicate properly instead of relying on a small group of writers to handle this. This is where the function of Content Management Systems comes in. Though I do agree with this sentiment, I also understand the common fear that this practice could possibly eliminate job security for technical communicators. 

Even with this fear, technical communicators have such a varied job that is constantly changing and morphing to fit whatever function is necessary for the organization or business to flourish, that I don’t believe Content Management Systems will be the death of the TC field. I think content management (if I understand correctly) has the potential to help many businesses with proper communication and also diminish issues that arise with improper communication and poor writing. 

I always like to support whatever helps an organization succeed in its venture. As Hart mentioned, poor communication has been the downfall of many businesses. Technical communicators, in my opinion, should support their company as well as the outside user. Writing is an important and powerful skill that can benefit everyone in a company and technical communicators can help guide the process and bring the produced product to its full potential.
