While reading through Core Competencies for Technical Communication, I found the competencies that were really stressed by technical communication managers to be quite different from what I expected. The stress on collaborative skills was very surprising to me, especially since on several occasions, it is mentioned as one of the most important skill sets. Followed closely by writing clearly for specific audiences and then understanding various technologies. 

All three of these items make perfect sense for technical communicators, though as students, we are taught to place more emphasis on writing for the audience and technologies, with collaborative skills placing in third place. The fact that these values are so different between managers in the technical communication community and students is curious. Because of these discrepancies, I understand better why managers can become frustrated with new TC hires. 

As I found from my technical communication job search assignment, many job listings do place a heavy emphasis on applicants being well versed in these technologies and many other abilities. I was intrigued to see the willingness of many managers to conduct on the job training for new hires who may not know the various technologies that are necessary. Even though many job ads have extensive requirements and wish lists of skills, an eagerness to learn and a harmonious attitude can take you a long way. 

I donâ€™t think this should dissuade students or new hires from trying to learn different tools and technologies in order to help in the future. These things make you into a well-rounded person and not always can you rely on the possibility that the company or TC manager will be able to train you. 
 
I found this article very interesting and enlightening. To have this insight into what future employers may be looking for in an employee is extremely helpful for the future.
