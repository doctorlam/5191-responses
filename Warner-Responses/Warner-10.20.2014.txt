I found it very interesting how Albers observed both sides to a common argument in technical communication: single source or keep it old school? On the side of craftsman writing, I couldn't help but agree with the phrase "Jack of all trades-master of none". I don't think that this is exactly true, but I do agree that it is somewhat of a fine line that technical communicators tread. Learning the basics of technical communication is a necessity for all technical communicators. Knowing how to write and edit are the foundation. 

By keeping up with the constant changes in software and technology, TC’s can lose their way on the writing and editing front. But in an ever-changing climate, not keeping up can leave a technical communicator in the dust and possibly without a job.  Single sourcing is a looming possibility for the technical communication field. It could help a great deal with the ability to use the same writing for several different audiences. This is increasingly helpful, especially because writing for several different audiences can be very difficult.  

Albers’ view gave me a lot to think about in regards to the fine line between single sourcing and craftsmanship. He eased a few of my trepidations of the workplace. So many job ads require a vast knowledge in technology and the amount is often times daunting. I understand that Albers is trying to imply that TC’s don’t need to know as many of the “required” software as they think they do, but all the same, I am glad to be learning the foundations for single sourcing for the future.
