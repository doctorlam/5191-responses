In her article, Rockley talks about how in the past few years, technical communicators have focused a little too much on technological skill. Because of this focus, writing and effective communication have gone by the wayside. Single sourcing can help focus technical communicators on the task at hand. Single sourcing allows technical writers to communicate on a human level, but also technologically. Learning to put content into various platforms and make it effective for the users is becoming something that all technical communicators must understand. But same as technical communicators have to evolve, so does the technology that they use. 

Single sourcing seems small when compared to the idea of companies adopting content management practices and ideas. Instead of thinking on a small scale like single sourcing, the authors believe that a step towards content and knowledge management would be the ideal direction for the technical communication field. Though technical communicators donâ€™t usually have much to do with content management, they are poised perfectly to lead the trend. This means a shift as technical communicators, but also in the companies that hire them. More and more businesses are coming to the realization that they need help and that the help lies in writing and user/business communication. This may be a perfect opportunity for technical communicators to prove their usefulness and also, provide a more stable working position.
