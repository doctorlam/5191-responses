<h3> What do Clark and Andersen say about technologies like XML? How does technology, and XML in particular, fit into their notion of sustainable technical communication? </h3>
<p> Clark and Andersen do not talk too much about XML at all. They focus on how thinking of ‘technology as a tool’ can isolate technical communicators from the rest of the organization. These two talk about the problems with restricting design knowledge to solving limited rhetorical problems reduces the importance of technical communicators. The authors think that the focus on XML and other content management technologies as a technology for all problems is not the best solution. Technical communicators are looked at as sophisticated end-users of tools developed by others, but they do not think of how they can use these technologies to benefit the company. </p>
<p> The focus for students should not be just on learning tools, but on the business and information systems that can help us gain respect in the organization. The dependence on ‘technology as tools’ is not the best way to be valued in the industry, and too much reliance on content management technologies is not desirable either. A critical analysis of design of technologies to save time and money for the company is what Clark and Andersen advice. Developing a business environment for a workplace is more important than the technical aspects required for the workplace. So, for the two authors, technology comes secondary to a proper understanding of how companies can better use our talents. </p>
