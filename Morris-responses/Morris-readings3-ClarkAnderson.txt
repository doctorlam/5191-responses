What do Clark and Anderson say about technologies like XML? 
How does technology (and XML in particular) fit into their notion of sustainable technical communication? 

Clark and Anderson state that technologies like XML can be an inherent benefit to technical communicators.
They caution, though, that technical communicators can become so trapped in learning tools and software packages that meet narrow job specifications that they will lose the essence of what makes them technical communicators - especially their rhetorical skills.
However, Clark and Anderson warn that technical communicators are building "silos" around themselves, thus reducing their visibility, and ensuring companies do not utilize their skills as best they can.
Particularly when technical communicators are typecast as specialist end-users of specialist products, their rhetorical skills - the backbone of a technical communicator's skillset - is completely reduced. 
Clark and Anderson, therefore, suggest that technical communicators need to:
	# Train for design credibility
	# Train for organizational credibility

One key aspect Clark and Anderson highlight is the way technology is driving technical communicators, both in academia and in the workplace. In their view, this is putting the cart before the horse. 
Rather than be beholden to technology, blindly accepting the premises behind each new technology, technical communicators should consider the rhetorical impact of using a particularly technology. 
In such an example, using the freedom and abilities of a technology such as XML could be incredibly useful - but only once the technology has been rhetorical vetted, and once the positive use of the technology proven. 
The authors present sustainable technical communication as a state where technical communicators have an active role in the design and teaching process.
Rather than accepting developer-driven tutorials, or only using specific tools as mandated, technical communicators should extend themselves and demonstrate their abilities - especially their rhetorical abilities - in adding value and preventing loss to a companies bottom line: the quickest way to establish usefulness within an organization.
In the authors view, sustainable technical communication can be secured through technical communicators thinking critically about the tools at their disposal, and integrating their rhetorical skills into broader job descriptions.
By breaking down silos, and inserting themselves into the design process, technical communicators will have success in proving design and organizational credibility, and earn trust to develop the industry further.
