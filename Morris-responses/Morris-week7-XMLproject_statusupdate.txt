Week 7 Reflection
Status Update on XML Project

I have progressed far on my XML project. I have the skeleton of my database in place and I have successfully linked my XML database to an XSLT file. 
The next stage is to continue "plugging in" the items for my database and ensuring they display accurately when I export to HTML.
Once I have my complete XML database and translate it fully through XSLT, I will apply a .css stylesheet and begin researching various javascript options to make my table sortable in various columns. 
I am thinking about a second transformation and am considering exporting as a Microsoft Excel file.
I am happy with where I am right now in this project and am excited to see the final results.

Questions:
1. Am I missing anything in my XML database hierarchy? e.g. do I need to develop my hierarchy further, or any apparent concerns I may have missed?
2. Do you recommend me continuing with my idea to include DVDs, CDs, and books as part of my dataset or should I pick one and stay with that?
3. Is the reflection .txt file due next week the reflection paper due as part of the final "deliverables and requirements?"
4. Do you have any advice about incorporating image files into the XML database, and do you have any sources I can explore to help me in this attempt?
5. Do you have any further comments or suggestions I can think about when completing this project?
