I found it interesting that the competencies that had the highest average ranking were skills that did not require the communicator to be proficient in a lot of advanced software. There seemed to be groupings of skill types that were all rated similarly, starting with the ability to effectively collaborate and adjust to whatever work situation you’re in. The second highest grouping of skills were centered on the ability to produce and edit quality documents. On the lower end of the spectrum, the last grouping of skills were those which involved more advanced technological competencies. 

This was not what I would have expected when looking at a list of required skills for a technical communicator. I thought that the ratings would be higher for skills requiring computer based skills since a lot of work in the technical communication field is based around the evolving technology around us. I also expected for the ability to write effectively to be one of the highest rated skills, but I guess the desired writing skill level of an individual is variable depending on the type of technical communication job they do. Upon further thought however, I realized that it is much more efficient to work with a cooperative team that can pool our knowledge and skills than in a group composed of independently tech savvy people. 

Both surveys 	seemed to yield similar results in expectations of technical competencies. This was surprising to me because I thought that the survey of undergraduate students would most likely be less informed on what hiring managers would want in an employee, instead, the participants had a lot of the same opinions on what qualities are important to possess as a technical communicator. This article has made me realize that my future employers will most likely not be focused solely on my ability to be technologically competent, but will be more concerned with me being competent in collaboration and writing.
