This article is from 10 years ago, and some of the technical needs that managers ranked lower are now required for many TC jobs. Technical competencies such as single-sourcing, creating interactive web sites, and designing effective interfaces are all competencies that were mentioned in numerous job ads I found while completing the corpus assignment. This article displays how TC adapts to technology as it happens instead of placing itself at the forefront of the technology. It is interesting that one of the top 30 competencies relates to employees being able to use outdated technology due to financial constraints. It seems that following Andersen’s advice and moving toward a more integrated approach to TC would help demonstrate the value TC brings to an organization and hopefully increase access to updated technology. 
According to the managers, the most important competencies include an applicant’s ability to collaborate and work with people and ability to adapt to and learn new technology. TC classes sometimes involve group work but students are not likely to be informed of how to effectively collaborate. For example, from the list of 141 competencies in TC course descriptions, only 2 competencies involve learning to collaborate. Technical skills are learned in some classes, but other classes do not require students to learn new software or work with technical products. An interesting idea from the article is that an applicant’s ability to quickly learn things is more important than knowing specific tools. 
Additionally, I was interested in the differences in the titles of that the university departments, courses, and course descriptions and how the disparity continued into the job titles and duties of the managers. Articles in TC consistently focus on what TC is and how we should identify ourselves, and I never thought of how the identity crisis would expand into TC departments.
